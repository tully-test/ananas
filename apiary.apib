# About Our APIs
At 70 countries and counting, Rovi is the leading entertainment data provider in the world.

## TV Schedules
Rovi Cloud gives you access to the television database created by TV Guide, the popular weekly American television magazine. Today that database takes in 5 million program changes every 24 hours and powers data, images, and TV schedules in magazines, websites, and television program guides in dozens of countries.

Rovi is everything TV.  Take advantage of it. Create a compelling entertainment experience that draws consumers to your app, device, service, or website around any combination&nbsp;of&nbsp;—
* Program recommendations
* US national television schedules
* Program data, images, and upcoming schedule
* International cable, satellite, and broadcast television schedules

### Understanding Television Services and Sources
To design and present a television listings grid with Rovi data, you first need a good understanding of television services and sources. 

#### What Is a Source?
A source is the source of a broadcast schedule for a television channel. Well known sources include AMC, HBO, and CSPAN.

The Rovi database ID for a source is a `data_source` ID.

Some sources provide programming for multiple channels, each with a different schedule. An example is Lifetime Television East, West, and high-definition. These are different broadcast schedules, so Rovi assigns a unique `data_source` ID to each of these.

Most channels offer programming from just one source, but some channels may broadcast more than one source on the same channel. There are two ways this happens:

- One, a channel broadcasts sources at different times, on different schedules, say one source from 6:00AM to 2:00PM, and another from 2:00PM to 12:00AM. In this case, you may want to provide two rows in your schedule for the channel when the schedule overlaps both sources.

- And two, a channel broadcasts two sources, SD and HD, on the same channel number at the same time. Satellite television receivers can tune to each channel separately, so SD receivers pick up the SD source and HD the HD. For this channel, Rovi returns information about both sources. You can choose to present just one of them, since the schedule will be the same for both. Or you can choose to present a different row for each source.

Note also that some channels do not offer 24-hour programming. You need to decide what you want to display during times they are not broadcasting.

To get details about a source, use the `data_source` ID in a [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource) request.

Use the same ID in all requests related to the source. For example, the same ID identifies the source in all of the requests in the following table:

| Request                      | Returns  |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource) | Details about the source. |
| [data_source_logos/best](/#reference/image/datasourcelogosbest) | Metadata about the primary logo for the source. |
| [data_source_logos/collection](/#reference/image/datasourcelogoscollection) | Metadata about all available logos for the source. |

#### What Is a Television Service?
A television service is a lineup of television channels. The Rovi database ID for a television service is a `data_service` ID.

Rovi identifies two types of television services: 

* A local lineup of television channels. For example:
  * Dish Network, US Eastern time zone (`data_service` ID 63879)
  * Local broadcast TV, Ontario, Canada (`data_service` ID 82905)
  * CanalSat, France Area Channels (Central Europe) (`data_service` ID 890504) 
* A Rovi-created lineup of US national television sources. This lineup isn't a real television service, rather it is a collection of the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like CNBC, HBO, and CSPAN, and as such this lineup cannot provide local channel numbers. Programming from these sources occurs at the same time throughout a time zone, and people using these listings likely know which channels these sources are on. Examples of US national sources include:
  * United States national services, Eastern time zone (`data_service` ID 341759807)
  * United States national services, Central time zone (`data_service` ID 341759808)
  * United States national services, Pacific time zone (`data_service` ID 341759810)

Some satellite and IPTV services also omit channel numbers, but those services provide devices that users can use to configure their channel sequence.

Some television services present a single broadcast source, such as CNN, on more than one channel for the convenience of people using different sections of the channel lineup. 

To get details about a television service, use the `data_service` ID in a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) request.

Use the same ID in all requests related to the television service. For example, the same ID identifies the television service in all of the requests in the following table:

| Request                      | Returns  |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) | Details about the television service. |
| [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk) | Channel data at 50 channels per request. |
| [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle) | Channel data at one channel per request.  |
| [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen) | Channel data at 10 channels per request. |
| [data_service_schedules/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesbulk) | Six hours of TV listings at 50 channels per request. |
| [data_service_schedules/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulessingle) | One day of TV listings at one channel per request. |
| [data_service_schedules/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesscreen) | Four hours of TV listings at 10 channels per request. |
| [data_series_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataseriesappearances) | TV series broadcast schedule on the television service. |
| [data_episode_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataepisodeappearances) | Episode broadcast schedule on the television service. |
| [data_movie_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/datamovieappearances) | Movie broadcast schedule on the television service. |
| [data_other_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataotherappearances) | Program broadcast schedule on the television service. |

#### Calculating Local Broadcast Times
Rovi returns program broadcast times in UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time), so you need to apply the local UTC offset to calculate the local time. We include the local offset in the information we return about a television service.
 
The format we use for broadcast times is YYYY-MO-DDTHH:MI:SS.000Z, where:

<table style="margin:0px 6px 0px 36px;">
<tr><td><ul>
<li>YYYY = year</li>
<li>MO&nbsp;&nbsp; = month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>DD&nbsp;&nbsp; = day</li>
</ul></td><td><ul>
<li>HH = hour (00 to 23)</li>
<li>MI = minute</li>
<li>SS = second</li>
</ul></td>
</table>

Note that the letter T precedes the time and that, to indicate UTC time, the date-time ends with the letter Z. (UTC time is also known as Zulu time.)

Here's an example: 2015-03-05T23:00:00Z. This is the broadcast time for the 6:00 pm news on March 5, 2015 in New York City. The UTC offset for that date in New York is minus 300 minutes (5 hours). Subtracting 300 minutes from the 23:00 time results in 18:00 (6:00 pm).

Because local offsets change with daylight savings time, offset information is returned with applicable start and end times like this: 

```json
    {
        "start": "2014-03-09T07:00:00.000Z",
        "end": "2014-11-02T06:00:00.000Z",
        "offset": -240
    },
    {
        "start": "2014-11-02T06:00:00.000Z",
        "end": "2015-03-08T07:00:00.000Z",
        "offset": -300
    }
```

Note that for the second daylight savings time change, your TV schedule would have two time periods from 1:00 am to 2:00 am local time, and that for the first change your schedule would have no 2:00 am to 3:00 am time period.

For locales that do not observe daylight savings time, the time period covers the calendar year and the offset does not change. For Regina, Saskatchewan, for example, time zone information looks like this: 

```json
    {
        "start": "2014-01-01T06:00:00.000Z",
        "end": "2015-01-01T06:00:00.000Z",
        "offset": -360
    },
    {
        "start": "2015-01-01T06:00:00.000Z",
        "end": "2016-01-01T06:00:00.000Z",
        "offset": -360
    }
```

Note also that time zone offsets occur on the half hour in some countries. 

### Present a Local TV Schedule
The Rovi Cloud API delivers TV listings data for a television service for the current UTC date or for any UTC date in the next two weeks. The API delivers TV listings in two steps: 1) one call for a list of channels and the data you may need for those channels, and 2) a second call for the corresponding program schedule for each of those channels.

The call for the program schedule always returns data in channel sequence. So channels are uniquely identified by their sequence in the list of channels. If you cache channel details, you can just update schedule data as needed.

Follow these steps to present a local TV schedule:
        
1. Call [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) to display the list of local television services, and allow the user to select a service.
2. If you need to display more detail about the service, grab the `data_service` ID and call [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice).
3. Grab and store the IDs you need:
  - `data_service`  
  - `data_service_channels`  
  - `data_service_schedule`  
4. Grab the time zone offset, used to calculate the local program time. (That offset changes when daylight saving time begins and ends.)
5. Decide on the response size that best meets your needs for delivering a broadcast schedule:
  -  Choose **/screen** for a block of 10 channels per request and 4 hours of data. Use this size to fill a grid schedule for immediate display.
  -  Choose **/single** for a block of 1 channel per request and 24 hours of data. Use this size to present information for a single channel in linear form, instead of a grid.
  -  Choose **/bulk** for a block of 50 channels per request and 6 hours of data. Use this size to fill a local store asynchronously in the background. This size returns a large amount of data and is not intended to be displayed all at once for a waiting user.
5. Request the first page of the channel lineup for the response block size you want:
  - [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)  
  - [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen) 
  - [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
6. For each channel, grab the `media_logo` ID and call [media_logo](/#reference/image/medialogo) to return the primary channel logo. Note: Some channel sources do not have logos.
7. To offer other channel detail, grab the `data_source` ID for the channel.
  - Call [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource) for all channel details.
  - Call [data_source_logos/best](/#reference/image/datasourcelogosbest) to find a different logo by specifying the logo characteristics you want.  
  - Call [data_source_logos/collection](/#reference/image/datasourcelogoscollection) to find a different logo by looking through information about all available logos for a channel.
8. Best Practice: Cache the channel and source information for the lineup. Typically an app won't need to request channel details more than once a day.
9. Request the first page of the TV listings that correspond to the response block size you selected for the channel lineup:
  - [data_service_schedules/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesbulk)
  - [data_service_schedules/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesscreen)
  - [data_service_schedules/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulessingle)
10. Grab relevant data you want for each program:
  - Start and end time (add the time zone offset to calculate local time).  
  - Title or alternate title.  
  - Audio level.  
  - Caption type.
  - Exhibition (live, new, repeat, taped).
  - Type of program (such as movie or series).  
  - Category (News, Movie, Music, Sports, Lifestyle, Children's, Other).
11. To present images in the schedule:
  - If an airing includes a `media_image` ID, call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to select a sized version of the original image, or [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to use the original image file.
  - If an airing includes a `data_content_images` ID, get the `media_image` ID of the image you want by calling [data_content_images/collection](/#reference/image/datacontentimagescollection) or [data_content_images/best](/#reference/image/datacontentimagesbest).   
12. Grab IDs to provide links or additional data for each program:
  - [data_airing_synopses/best](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingsynopses/best) for a synopsis.  
  - [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) for links to all information about the movie or program.  
13. Insert that page of TV listings (schedules data) into the corresponding rows (channels) you created from the channel response.
14. Paint that page.
15. Get the next page of channels and schedules data for the same response block size.
16. Repeat for all available channels.

### Present a Regional TV Schedule
Rovi Cloud can deliver TV schedule data for a broadcast source, such as HBO, CBS, and CNBC. These listings do not include channel data, but viewers in a region generally know which channels the major broadcast sources appear on.

Use Rovi Cloud source listings to present TV schedules for an entire time zone. Like local TV listings, source listings are available for the current UTC date and for any UTC date in the next two weeks.

Follow these steps to present TV listings for a time zone:

1. Collect the `data_source` IDs for the broadcast sources you want.
  - Get the `data_service` ID of a major television service in the region by calling [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice).
  - Use that `data_service` ID in a [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk) request.
  - Collect `data_source` IDs and `media_logo` IDs from the channel list for the broadcast sources you want.
2. For each broadcast source you want, request the schedule and logo.
  - With the `data_source` ID, call [data_source_airings](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasourceairings) to get the schedule.
  - With the `media_logo` ID, call [media_logo](/#reference/image/medialogo) to return the primary logo.
3. Grab relevant data you want for each program in the schedule:
  - Start and end time (add the time zone offset to calculate local time).  
  - Title or alternate title.  
  - Audio level.  
  - Caption type.
  - Exhibition (live, new, repeat, taped).
  - Type of program (such as movie or series).  
  - Category (News, Movie, Music, Sports, Lifestyle, Children's, Other).  
4. Grab IDs to provide links or additional data for each program:
  - [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) for links to all information about the movie or program.
  - [data_airing_synopses/best](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingsynopsesbest) for a synopsis.
  - [data_airing_credits/cast](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingcreditscast) for cast credits.
  - [data_airing_credits/credits](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingcreditscast) for all credits.
5. Best Practice: Cache the information. Typically an app won't need to request schedule details more than once a day.
6. Insert the logos and schedule data into a grid or page.
7. Paint the page.

### Present Data About a Program in a Television Schedule
Rovi Cloud offers extensive data and images for programs listed in a television schedule. Add a link for each program in the schedule and provide the content within the schedule or in a popup window or page:

1. Grab the `data_airing` ID for each program in the schedule and provide a link to the [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) call for each program.
2. When a user executes a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) link, grab data from the response, plus any IDs for data you want to return:
  - `data_movie`
  - `data_series`
  - `data_episode`
  - `data_other`
  - `data_airing_credits`
  - `data_airing_synopses`
  - `data_content_images`
3. Execute API calls for the additional content you want to display. *Note:* The response language of data_airing requests is determined by the broadcast source. For other requests, the response language can be specified by parameter.
  - [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie)
  - [data_series](/#reference/series/dataseries)
  - [data_episode](/#reference/episode/dataepisode)
  - [data_other](/#reference/other/dataother)
  - [data_airing_credits/cast](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingcreditscast)
  - [data_airing_credits/crew](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingcreditscrew)
  - [data_airing_credits/credits](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingcreditscredits)
  - [data_airing_synopses/best](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingsynopsesbest)
  - [data_airing_synopses/collection](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairingsynopsescollection)
  - [data_content_images/best](/#reference/image/datacontentimagesbest)
  - [data_content_images/collection](/#reference/image/datacontentimagescollection)
4. Paint the content.

## Return-Path Data
The Rovi Return-Path Data API lets you send clickstream data about TV viewer behavior to the Rovi Content Data Warehouse (CDW). The CDW is uniquely designed to handle clickstream events and TV viewership data and, as such, is designed to make available reliable, usable data through the Rovi Operator Insights portal.

The Return-Path Data API offers a single request that reports a variety of user actions.

## Remote Access
Rovi Remote Access enables cable companies to give subscribers remote access to their DVRs. Using an application on a tablet, computer, and smartphone, cable subscribers can discover shows, see their channel lineup, and program their i-Guide™ or Passport® Guide DVRs.

With Rovi Remote Access, the home DVR is available anywhere.

Rovi Remote Access is small API that offers two different configurations, one for manual registration of subscriber set-top boxes and one for auto registration. A cable company can choose to implement one or the other.
- Manual Registration requires the user to register a set-top box from the set-top box menu.
- Auto Registration registers all set-top boxes in a household automatically and offers many benefits not otherwise available.

Implementation of a Remote Access application requires additional documentation beyond the scope of the API documentation provided here. Contact your Rovi sales representative.

# Getting Started
Developing with Rovi Cloud is pretty simple, really, but you should already understand the following:

- The basic concepts of  HTTP, REST, and JSON.
- How to compose HTTP requests and parse JSON responses.
- The development environment and language you are using.

To receive data from Rovi Cloud, your website or application sends HTTP requests to the Rovi API server. The API server responds with the data in standard JSON format. 

For faster, easier application development, Rovi Cloud offers URI templates to specify API calls. A URI template is a simple specification of an API call that identifies parameters to be substituted before executing the call. The specification adheres to Internet standard [_URI Template_](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).

Here is an example of a URI template; notice that the named variables in curly brackets are parameters to be replaced:

    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/movie/{id}/ratings;country={country}
    
To turn a URI template into an API request, your application replaces the named variables in the template with percent-encoded values or empty values, according to the specification for the API request. At that point, the URI template, which might look like this, is an API request:

    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/movie/914806985/ratings;country=US
    
More detail about developing with templates is described below in the section [Developing With URI Templates](http://docs.rovicloudapi.apiary.io/#introduction/getting-started/developing-with-uri-templates?console=1).

#### Your Templates File
The templates you are authorized to use are contained in your templates file, in JSON format. Your application downloads your templates file and uses the URI templates there to render API requests.

You should hard code the URL to your templates file and download it at application start, or once a day, depending on your implementation. If the file hasn't changed, the template server returns a status code 304.

The URL to your templates file is the only hard-coded URL in your Rovi Cloud application. All other requests to Rovi Cloud are rendered from the URI templates in the templates file.

The URL to your templates file is constructed like this:

    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/template/v1/(YourConsumerKey)/(YourFileVersion)/templates.json
    
That URL contains two important segments you should know about:

| Segment                 | Description  |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Your Consumer&nbsp;Key  | When you register and log into your account, you can see your Consumer Key by clicking My Account -> Entitlements. Your Consumer Key, also known as your API key, is a public key that identifies your API requests. Provided with that key is a Consumer Secret Key, which you use to calculate authentication values. You should never transmit or reveal your Consumer Secret Key. |
| Your File&nbsp;Version number | Your templates file version is an integer, which is /1/ when you first sign up. This is the version number you pay attention to, not a Rovi Cloud version number. When an API upgrade changes the templates you are using, you are invited to upgrade your applications to your version /2/ templates file. You can upgrade at that time or, unless the update is critical, wait until a later version to upgrade. For more detail about version upgrades, see the section below titled "Templates File Version Upgrades." |

When you look at your templates file, you notice pairs and arrays of JSON name/value strings. For example, the following name/value pair shows the template name "data_movie_ratings" followed by the value, which is the URI template:

    "data_movie_ratings": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/lookup/movie/{id}/ratings;country={country}"

So, to get the data_movie_ratings URI template, your application searches the file for the name "data_movie_ratings" and then grabs and uses the value, which is the URI template.

And here's a sample array of name/value strings you might find in the file:

    "media_image": {
        "master": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/media/v1/source/{id}",
        "sized": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/media/v1/image/{zoom}/{size}/{aspect}/{id}.jpg"
    }

Here your application searches for "media_image", then searches for either "master" or "sized", and then grabs the associated string value and uses that to render the API request.

The following is a sample of the first few lines of a templates file, if formatted for readability. Note that before the list of templates is a URL for a schema. Use that URL to access your custom documentation, as described in the next section.

    {
        "schema": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/api/v1/137a4c38b79bc30fdea92589cf6ac35c4f041bc33bc801685175/1/api.raml",
        "templates": {
            "data_movie_ratings": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/lookup/movie/{id}/ratings;country={country}",
            "media_image": {
                "master": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/media/v1/source/{id}",
                "sized": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/media/v1/image/{zoom}/{size}/{aspect}/{id}.jpg"
                }
            }
        }
    }

#### Your Custom Documentation
Rovi Cloud provides documentation tailored specifically to the templates in your templates file. Unlike the public Rovi Cloud documentation, your custom documentation covers only the API requests you are authorized to make.

Your custom documentation is provided in a RAML file &mdash; a human-readable text file that can also be displayed in a RAML viewer.

To view your custom documentation as a text file, download the file using the link in your templates file associated with "schema."

To view your custom documentation in a RAML viewer, grab the link in your templates file associated with "schema" and append it to this link:

    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/api/v1/apiconsole.html?raml=

Then execute that link in a Chrome or Firefox Web browser.

## Developing With URI Templates

As mentioned above, you should use your templates file as a component of your application. How do you do that? And why?

#### The Big Picture

Above, you learned that, to make API calls to Rovi Cloud, your application needs to do the following:
- Download your templates file at application start, or once a day, depending on implementation.
- Then, for each API request:
  - Search your templates file for the template name of that API request, or for the template array name and then the template name.
  - Grab the associated string value, which is the URI template.
  - Substitute percent-encoded values or empty values for the named variables.

Then what? And why not just hard-code the URI template?

To answer the first question, once you replace those named variables with percent-encoded values (or empty values), the URI template IS a URL. It becomes a ready-to-be-executed API call. You can then add an HTTP 1.1 Authorization header as described below in [Authorizing Your Requests](http://docs.rovicloudapi.apiary.io/#introduction/getting-started/authorizing-your-requests?console=1) and execute the request. 

Now, how about why? Why not just hard-code those URLs? Or why not hard-code those URI templates?

Think about what's involved in URL construction and all of the things that go wrong over time. First, there's the learning curve, learning the structure and syntax of each call. Then as the API evolves, it requires another learning curve and an update of every application that uses the API. And when the version is about to expire, well, your other priorities have to wait.

By always copying your templates from your templates file, you always have API calls that work. Just have your app download your templates file every day or during startup. You can forget about the fine points of URI construction.

There are other benefits, as well. We can dynamically generate a different route path pattern to avoid problems. Or to deliver a faster response. Or to deliver custom API calls. And we can add named variables to improve a request (which does not break your current API request). So, not only are URI templates easier on you, they give us the flexibility to deliver a better service.

We count on your application using the latest URI templates available for the version you are on.

#### The Step-By-Step Procedure to Using URI Templates

If you haven't signed up for a data subscription yet, check out the sample templates file in the Reference section titled [Templates File](http://docs.rovicloudapi.apiary.io/#reference/templates-file).

Here are some guidelines for developing with URI templates.

1. Get familiar with our APIs by looking through the documentation here in the API Console.
  - Look through the section [About Our APIs](http://docs.rovicloudapi.apiary.io/#introduction/about-our-apis) to learn what the APIs do and the sequence in which they should be called.
  - For each call you want to use, study the documentation for that call in the Reference section.
2. Download your templates file at application start or once a day, depending upon your implementation.  As described above, we may generate nonbreaking changes to templates (but not to template names) at any time. The previous syntax will no longer function after a grace period, typically 30 days.
  - The templates service sends a 304 if the templates file has not changed since the last download.
  - Save a copy of the templates file to use in case the template service becomes momentarily unavailable.
3. Parse the JSON and keep it as an internal map. Use it to look up template names.

    You can parse the templates file using any open source JSON parser. 

4. Search for the template you want. For example, to return information about a movie, search for the name of the template: `data_movie`.

    `"data_movie": "http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/lookup/movie.(*,moods,tones,themes,keywords,aesthetics,audiences,periods,characters,importance,flags,rottenTomatoes,facebooks,twitters)/{id}?in={in},{in2},{in3}"`
    
5. Copy the template:

    `http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/lookup/movie.(*,moods,tones,themes,keywords,aesthetics,audiences,periods,characters,importance,flags,rottenTomatoes,facebooks,twitters)/{id}?in={in},{in2},{in3}`

6. Use an open source library that performs URI Template Level 1 substitution (the minimum level). A good list of libraries can be found [_here_](https://code.google.com/p/uri-templates/wiki/Implementations).
7. Have the library (or your application) substitute values for the parameters, percent encoding each value before substitution.
  - For details about percent encoding parameter values, see the section [Percent Encoding Parameter Values](#introduction/getting-started/percent-encoding-parameter-values).
  - Do not percent encode values for test calls you make here in the API Console. The API Console does that for you.
  - If you omit a value of an optional parameter, replace it with an empty value. Do not delete commas or otherwise alter the structure of the template. For example, after filling in the ID and only one of the three optional values, the rendered URL for the data_movie template would be:
        `http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2/lookup/movie.(*,moods,tones,themes,keywords,aesthetics,audiences,periods,characters,importance,flags,rottenTomatoes,facebooks,twitters)/914806985?in=en-US,,`
  - Look for additional optional parameters in a loop and replace them with empty values. We may add optional parameters to templates in the current version of your templates file. Note these as resources for further application development.
8. Construct an Authorization header that provides OAuth 1.0a credentials. For details, including recommendations of open source libraries that support OAuth1.0a, see the section [Authorizing Your Requests](#introduction/getting-started/authorizing-your-requests).
9. Make the call. Here's the response for our sample call.

10. Parse the response and grab the data you want to display. 

    Note that the __ref__ object presents names of templates that offer additional information.
    
11. Ignore unexpected fields in the response.

    We may add new fields to responses. Note these as resources for further application development.

12. Present links to information offered by the __ref__ object&mdash;or just make any of the calls and present the information.
  - If you want cast information, for example, you pick the call "data_movie_credits" and then pick which of the templates you want:
    - [cast](/#reference/movie/datamoviecreditscast)
    - [crew](/#reference/movie/datamoviecreditscrew)
    - [credits](/#reference/movie/datamoviecreditscredits)      
  - Then render the URL and make the call.

13. For each call you make, repeat the sequence:
  - Find the template by name.
  - Copy the template.
  - Fill in values for required and optional parameters, leaving empty values empty.
  - Construct an OAuth 1.0a Authorization header.
  - Make the call.
  - Parse the response and present the information.
  - From IDs in that response, present links to that information or pick a template by name and repeat the sequence.

#### Templates File Version Upgrades
One of the benefits of developing with templates is that the only Rovi Cloud version number you are concerned with is the version number of your templates file. That number is the integer in the next-to-last path segment in the file link, which is the /1/ in the link to your first templates file, like this:

    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/template/v1/(YourConsumerKey)/1/templates.json

Each upgrade to your templates file increases the version number by one, so the /1/ becomes /2/ and then /3/ and so on. A version upgrade just indicates a breaking change, not whether the improvement is small or large.

If an upgrade does not change features you are using, you may choose to wait until a later version to upgrade. We might, however, ask you to upgrade for a critical change, such as for a security issue. The length of time you have to upgrade in such circumstances is specified in your contract with Rovi.

Before you upgrade, you can check out the changes in the new version and test them in the API Console. Log into your account and download the new version of your template as follows:

1. Log into your account.
2. Select __My Account__ and then select __Templates__.
3. Select the version you want to download.
4. Click __Download__. 

After you upgrade and when no applications are calling a previous version, we may choose to end support for that version.

## Percent Encoding Parameter Values

Unlike the API requests you try out here in the API Console, your application must percent encode all parameter values it substitutes into API templates. That includes parameter values that are returned by a previous API request, such as value returned by a Search request that can now be used to return the next page of results.

The API Console takes care of percent encoding for you.

Failure to percent encode template arguments results in a 401 error, an authorization error, because that changes the semantics of the URL.

At the same time, your application must not modify characters in the template in any way. You just provide percent encoded or empty values for all of the bracketed parameters in the template.

The URL encoding function in your client library should work just fine for parameter values. But libraries vary somewhat, and offer optional settings, so the rules we follow are specified here.

The following characters in parameter values are never percent encoded:

- Alphanumeric characters: 0-9a-zA-Z
- Special characters: $ - _ . ! * ' ( )

The following characters in parameter values _must_ be percent encoded:

- Space
- URL-encoding markers: % +
- Unsafe characters: " < > # { } | \ ^ [ ] `
- Reserved characters (URI delimiters): & , / : ; = ? @
- Non-ASCII characters, the entire top half of the ISO-Latin set, 80-FF hex (128-255 decimal)
- ASCII Control characters, the ISO-8859-1 (ISO-Latin) character ranges 00-1F hex (0-31 decimal) and 7F (127 decimal)

A tilde (~) character _should_ be percent encoded in parameter values, but will be accepted in raw form.

A space character in query parameters _should_ be percent encoded as +, but will be accepted as %20. In path parameters, a space _must_ be percent encoded as %20.

If you have control over character encoding, we recommend you percent encode the tilde (~) and percent encode the space in query parameters as +.

Note:  OAuth 1.0a authentication, which is required for each request, also requires percent-encoded parameter values, but percent encoding in OAuth 1.0a follows a slightly different standard than the percent encoding described here.

## Authorizing Your Requests

To authenticate your requests, Rovi Cloud requires an HTTP 1.1 Authorization header with each request that provides OAuth 1.0a credentials. OAuth 1.0a is an authentication protocol described by [IETF RFC 5849](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849).

OAuth 1.0a:
        
+   Uniquely identifies you from your security keys.
+   Guards against replay attacks by requiring a unique string in each call.
+   Does not require SSL/TLS, token state management, or certificate verification.
+   Ensures security through a hash function on a string concatenation that incorporates a secret key.
        
OAuth 1.0a is supported by multiple open source libraries. We recommend Jersey and Signpost OAuth. 

To test your calls, we recommend the following: 

+   [This version of Postman, a Chrome web browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-short/mkhojklkhkdaghjjfdnphfphiaiohkef?hl=en). On the OAuth 1.0 tab, be sure to check the following boxes and refresh the request before sending each request:

    + Add params to header
    + Auto add parameters

+   [RESTClient, a Firefox web browser add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/). Be sure to check the following boxes on the Authentication OAuth setting tab:
        
    +   Realm Disabled
    +   oAuth Nonce Auto
    +   oAuth Timestamp Auto

### Overview
        
Specify the required OAuth parameters as follows:
        
+   `oauth_version`   
    Applicable version of the OAuth specification. For this parameter, specify: `1.0`.
    
+   `oauth_signature_method`   
    The method used to sign and verify requests. For this parameter, specify the case-sensitive value: `HMAC-SHA1`.                   
    
+   `oauth_nonce`   
    An alphanumeric string that is different in each request. The server checks the nonce to verify that a request has never been made before, which guards against replay attacks. Any method that generates a new alphanumeric string of characters for each request is acceptable.
    
+   `oauth_timestamp`    
    The UNIX time. Unix time is a timestamp supported in most development environments and is generally defined as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
    
    The time must be within 60 seconds of the server time, so generate this value at the time the request is executed.
    
+   `oauth_consumer_key`   
    Your Consumer Key, provided by Rovi when you signed up for the service. Also called an API key, this is the public key that authorizes your access to Rovi Cloud.
    
    __Note:__ &ensp; _The Consumer Secret, provided with your Consumer Key, should never be transmitted. You use the Consumer Secret in the generation of the oauth_signature._
    
+   `oauth_signature`
    A calculated authorization code. Because the calculation requires a unique percent encoding scheme and involves quite a few steps, the section following explains how to calculate the value, and then another section provides sample Java code that performs the calculation.
    
    For reference, however, the calculation the HMAC-SHA1 signature method is described in [section 3.4.2 of The OAuth 1.0 Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2).
    
    +  Do not specify a realm, oauth_token, or token shared-secret.
    +  For the client shared-secret, use the Consumer Secret that was provided with your Consumer Key.
    +  Perform the calculation at the time of each request to be sure it's within 60 seconds of the server time.
              
Here is a sample authorization header:
        
`Authorization: OAuth oauth_version="1.0",oauth_consumer_key="aza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0",oauth_timestamp="1406676129",oauth_nonce="qfPkLmPw6T0",oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",oauth_signature="gWtfDzqloKwDkF911V48OrIo7fY%3D"`
                                
### Calculating the OAuth Signature
        
Calculating the oauth_signature is the most complicated part of the protocol, so this section provides an explanation to guide you through it. Let's use the following URI template to demonstrate the process. __Note:__ &ensp; _This template may be different from one provided in your templates file. The URI templates you are authorized to use are provided in your templates file._
    
    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2.4/browse/service;country={country};postalCode={postalCode};msoId={msoId};offering=AU,BR,CA,CN,IN,EUR,LTA,RU,SEA,US,TR?idns=&page={page}&size=20
    
Building our request from the URI template above, here is our request.
    
    http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2.4/browse/service;country=CA;postalCode=K1N%206N5;msoId=;offering=AU,BR,CA,CN,IN,EUR,LTA,RU,SEA,US,TR?idns=&page=1&size=20
    
Parameter values must be percent-encoded, so note that the space in the path parameter `postalCode=K1N 6N5` is correctly encoded as %20 and not as +. A space can be percent encoded as + only within query parameter values, not path parameter values.

Now that we have the request, we can collect the strings we use to calculate the OAuth signature. We collect three string variables that consist of percent-encoded components of the request and the OAuth parameters.

#### Collect the Request Method String

First, assign the uppercase request method (GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE) to a string variable, say, httpMethod:

httpMethod: &emsp; `GET`

#### Collect the Base String

Now assign the base URL, which is the URL up to the question mark (or to the end of the URL if there is no question mark), to a string variable. Here we use the variable baseString:

baseString: &emsp; `http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2.4/browse/service;country=CA;postalCode=K1N%206N5;msoId=;offering=AU,BR,CA,CN,IN,EUR,LTA,RU,SEA,US,TR`

Now percent encode the value of baseString using the procedure described in the section below "Percent Encode the OAuth 1.0a Way." Note that we even percent encode the already percent-encoded space, so %20 becomes %2520.

baseString: &emsp; `http%3A%2F%2Fcloud.rovicorp.com%2Fdata%2F2%2F2.4%2Fbrowse%2Fservice%3Bcountry%3DCA%3BpostalCode%3DK1N%25206N5%3BmsoId%3D%3Boffering%3DAU%2CBR%2CCA%2CCN%2CIN%2CEUR%2CLTA%2CRU%2CSEA%2CUS%2CTR`

#### Collect the OAuth and Query Parameters String

Now let's collect, sort, and encode the OAuth and query parameters. Query parameters are the parameter=value pairs that come after the question mark in the request. We start with the raw parameter values, the values before they are percent encoded.

Collect the raw query parameters and the OAuth parameters and sort them alphabetically by name. For a PUT or POST request, do not include the request body. If a request has no query parameters, the only parameters in the list are the OAuth parameters.

Here is the list for our sample request:

| Parameter              |  Parameter Value                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| idns                   |                                                                   |
| oauth_consumer_key     | aza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0  |
| oauth_nonce            | qfPkLmPw6T0                                                       |
| oauth_signature_method | HMAC-SHA1                                                         |
| oauth_timestamp        | 1406676129                                                        |
| oauth_version          | 1.0                                                               |
| page                   | 1                                                                 |
| size                   | 20                                                                |

Percent encode every parameter and parameter value in the parameter list using the procedure described in the section below "Percent Encode the OAuth 1.0a Way." Parameter names are generally unchanged by that procedure.

| Parameter, Percent-Encoded |  Parameter Value, Percent-Encoded                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| idns                   |                                                                   |
| oauth_consumer_key     | aza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0  |
| oauth_nonce            | qfPkLmPw6T0                                                       |
| oauth_signature_method | HMAC-SHA1                                                         |
| oauth_timestamp        | 1406676129                                                        |
| oauth_version          | 1.0                                                               |
| page                   | 1                                                                 |
| size                   | 20                                                                |

The list for this particular request is unchanged.

We now collect these parameters and values in a string, as follows:
  
  1.  Assign the first parameter to a string variable. Here we use the variable parameterString:
  
      parameterString: &emsp; `idns`

  2.  Then append an equal sign and the encoded parameter value.
  
      parameterString: &emsp; `idns=`
  
  3.  Then append an ampersand (&), followed by the next encoded parameter, equal sign, and encoded parameter value.
  
      parameterString: &emsp; `idns=&oauth_consumer_key=aza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0`
  
  4.  Repeat step 3 for each parameter in the list.

      parameterString: &emsp; `idns=&oauth_consumer_key=aza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0&oauth_nonce=qfPkLmPw6T0&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&oauth_timestamp=1406676129&oauth_version=1.0&page=1&size=20`
      
  5.  Now percent encode the value of parameterString using the procedure described below in "Percent Encode the OAuth 1.0a Way." Note that we percent encode the equal signs and ampersands we just added, as well as any percent signs we added during the previous percent encoding.
  
      parameterString: &emsp; `idns%3D%26oauth_consumer_key%3Daza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0%26oauth_nonce%3DqfPkLmPw6T0%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D1406676129%26oauth_version%3D1.0%26page%3D1%26size%3D20`

#### Generate the Signature Base String

Now we concatenate the three strings we created into a single string. We are calling this string signatureBaseString.

  1.  Assign to signatureBaseString that uppercase string httpMethod.
      
      signatureBaseString: &emsp; `GET`
      
  2.  Append an ampersand (&).
      
      signatureBaseString: &emsp; `GET&`
      
  3.  Append baseString to signatureBaseString.
      
      signatureBaseString: &emsp; `GET&http%3A%2F%2Fcloud.rovicorp.com%2Fdata%2F2%2F2.4%2Fbrowse%2Fservice%3Bcountry%3DCA%3BpostalCode%3DK1N%25206N5%3BmsoId%3D%3Boffering%3DAU%2CBR%2CCA%2CCN%2CIN%2CEUR%2CLTA%2CRU%2CSEA%2CUS%2CTR`
      
  4.  Append an ampersand (&).
      
      signatureBaseString: &emsp; `GET&http%3A%2F%2Fcloud.rovicorp.com%2Fdata%2F2%2F2.4%2Fbrowse%2Fservice%3Bcountry%3DCA%3BpostalCode%3DK1N%25206N5%3BmsoId%3D%3Boffering%3DAU%2CBR%2CCA%2CCN%2CIN%2CEUR%2CLTA%2CRU%2CSEA%2CUS%2CTR&`
      
  5.  Append parameterString to signatureBaseString.
      
      signatureBaseString: &emsp; `GET&http%3A%2F%2Fcloud.rovicorp.com%2Fdata%2F2%2F2.4%2Fbrowse%2Fservice%3Bcountry%3DCA%3BpostalCode%3DK1N%25206N5%3BmsoId%3D%3Boffering%3DAU%2CBR%2CCA%2CCN%2CIN%2CEUR%2CLTA%2CRU%2CSEA%2CUS%2CTR&idns%3D%26oauth_consumer_key%3Daza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0%26oauth_nonce%3DqfPkLmPw6T0%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D1406676129%26oauth_version%3D1.0%26page%3D1%26size%3D20`
      
      Note that the result string contains only two ampersand (&) characters.

#### Generate the Key String

Now that we have the signatureBaseString, the last thing we need before we calculate the OAuth signature is the key string. Follow these two steps:

  1.  Percent encode your Consumer Secret and assign the result to keyString.
      
      keyString: &emsp; `1y2g9e33e485633c5901t469189nn6ade8879afbada65b9ssb3661009722da7e`
      
  2.  Append an ampersand (&)
      
      keyString: &emsp; `1y2g9e33e485633c5901t469189nn6ade8879afbada65b9ssb3661009722da7e&`
      
#### Generate the OAuth Signature

We performed all of the previous steps for a single value, the value of the oauth_signature parameter. To generate the oauth_signature, we use the HMAC-SHA1 hashing function, which is available in all popular development environments. Follow these steps:

  1.  In the HMAC-SHA1 function, assign the value of signatureBaseString to the data string.
  
  2.  Assign the value of keyString to the key string.
  
  3.  Execute the function. The result is a binary string, such as:
  
      B6 79 C0 AF 18 F4 E9 C5 87 AB 8E 20 0A CD 4E 48 A9 3F 8C B6
  
  4.  Base64 encode the result.
      
      oauth_signature: &emsp; `gWtfDzqloKwDkF911V48OrIo7fY=`

  5.  Finally, percent encode the value.
      
      oauth_signature: &emsp; `gWtfDzqloKwDkF911V48OrIo7fY%3D`

#### Execute the Request

When we have the oauth_signature, we can execute the request. Our request looks like this:
    
    GET http://cloud.rovicorp.com/data/2/2.4/browse/service;country=CA;postalCode=K1N%206N5;msoId=;offering=AU,BR,CA,CN,IN,EUR,LTA,RU,SEA,US,TR?idns=&page=1&size=20
    Content-Type: application/json   
    Authorization: OAuth oauth_version="1.0",oauth_consumer_key="aza9g187u945e790805067eb37ec7de4bfda955v17cf898c16280bc532866af0",oauth_timestamp="1406676129",oauth_nonce="qfPkLmPw6T0",oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",oauth_signature="gWtfDzqloKwDkF911V48OrIo7fY%3D

### Percent Encode the OAuth 1.0a Way

Percent encoding for OAuth 1.0a is different from the URL encoding protocol used by Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. OAuth 1.0a percent encoding follows these rules:

  +  Text characters are first converted to UTF-8 per [RFC3629](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629).
  +  Then each UTF-8 character is either percent encoded or not.
  +  The following characters must NOT be percent encoded: 
     +  &ensp; a &ndash; z &ensp; (lowercase alpha, &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x61 &ndash; 0x7A)
     +  &ensp; A &ndash; Z &ensp; (uppercase alpha, &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x41 &ndash; 0x5A)
     +  &ensp; 0 &ndash; 9 &ensp; (numeric digits, &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x30 &ndash; 0x39)
     +  &ensp; ~ &ensp; (tilde &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x7E)
     +  &ensp; . &ensp; (period &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x2E)
     +  &ensp; - &ensp; (hyphen &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x2D)
     +  &ensp; _ &ensp; (underscore &nbsp; UTF-8 &nbsp;0x5F)
  +  Other characters must be percent encoded per [RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).
  +  Hexadecimal alpha characters (A &ndash; F) must be represented as upper case.
  +  A space must be represented as %20, not as a plus sign (+).

The following steps describe how to percent encode for OAuth 1.0a. This procedure works for all languages, for all single and multibyte characters.

  1.  Convert all characters in the source string to UTF-8.
  
  2.  Declare a result string, say ENCODED, to hold the percent-encoded string.
  
  3.  Begin a loop, reading the source string byte-by-byte as hexadecimal characters until all bytes are read.
  
  4.  If a byte matches a character that must not be percent encoded (listed above), append that byte to ENCODED.
  
  5.  Otherwise, append 0x25 (%) to ENCODED and then append the two alpha or numeric hexadecimal characters that represent that character. For example, the UTF-8 hexadecimal representation for the plus sign is 0x2B, so you would append %2B.
      
      You also need to percent encode the percent-encoded characters in the string. For example, a percent-encoded space, %20, turns into %2520.
      
### Authorization FAQ

  1.  My OAuth 1.0a authorization worked just fine with one request, but failed on the next request. What's up with that?
  
      Probably the first request did not get authenticated. The API skips authentication under certain circumstances, such as when the response is available from the cache or the authentication subsystem is down. Also some requests do not require authentication.
  
  2.  Do I need to provide an OAuth 1.0a Authorization header to see the API Console?
  
      No, the request for the API Console is not authenticated, nor are the documentation requests the API Console makes (requests that end in "api.raml").
     
  3.  It looks like the URL to the API Console contains a Consumer Key that does not match my Consumer Key. Will my requests, with my Consumer Key, be authenticated?
  
      You are probably looking at the public API Console, which has a public Consumer Key. Yes, a request with your Consumer Key will work for a request in the public API Console if your data subscription includes that request. A better practice, though, is to use your API Console, which shows the requests you are subscribed to. That API Console contains your unique Consumer Key in the URL.

## Supported Locales
API requests that include the `in` parameter can return content in a specified language or even in the localized language of a specified country. 

To specify a language, use the two-character ISO 639 language code, like this: `fr`.

To specify a language and country, add a hyphen to the language code and the two-character ISO 3166 country code, like this: `fr-CA`.

The table below shows the languages and countries for which there is currently strong API data coverage. If localized content is not available, we return the non-localized content. If content is not available in that language, another language will be chosen based on fallback rules. However, most requests that support the `in` parameter also give you the option to also specify second and third fallback choices.

We are constantly adding content and building our data coverage around the globe. The following table shows the regions for which there is currently strong API data coverage. Language and country codes are case-sensitive.

## App Design With Rovi Cloud
Here are a few useful guidelines that will help you create a great app with the Rovi Cloud API.

### Understanding Database IDs in Rovi Cloud
Key to designing your app is effective use of the database IDs that Rovi Cloud recognizes and returns in responses. Here are the main points you need to know about Rovi Cloud IDs:

- Rovi Cloud IDs are unique (positive) integers and are different from IDs in previous and legacy databases.
- If you use legacy IDs in a current application, you can use those IDs in Rovi Cloud and, at the same time, get the Rovi Cloud IDs to replace those legacy IDs. See the next section.
- A Rovi Cloud ID for a show may be identified by two different field labels:
  - By category: a data_content ID.
  - By type: a data_movie ID, data_series ID, data_season ID, data_episode ID, data_other ID, or data_release ID.
  - So there is only one ID of any type for a show, but either label may apply.
- If you have a Rovi Cloud ID for a show, you can call [data_content](/#reference/content/datacontent) to get information about the ID.
- A Rovi Cloud ID for a person may also be identified by two different field labels:
  - By a data_person ID.
  - By a data_name ID.
  - So a person has only one ID, but both labels may apply.
  - Teams and organizations have only data_name IDs.
- Because you need an ID to get detailed information about a show or person, the entry points for entertainment data in Rovi Cloud are:
  - The Search and Recommendation requests.
  - Local television schedules. TV schedules return IDs for the [data_airing](#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request, which in turn returns IDs to other requests that deliver all of the localized and translatable data available about a movie or program.
- Requests that return data about particular movie, episode, release, person, etc. all use the same ID. So, for example, the ID you use to get movie data about Kung Fu Panda, the data_movie ID 914806985, is the same ID that is used for all associated requests:
  - data_movie
  - data_movie_aired
  - data_movie_appearances
  - data_movie_awards
  - data_movie_credits
  - data_movie_ratings
  - data_movie_related
  - data_movie_review
  - data_movie_synopses
  - data_content_images
- When an API response returns an ID that can be used in a different API request, there is no guarantee that the referenced request has available data to return. Rovi Cloud IDs are static, designed around the structure of the data. Therefore you are advised to program an alternate path for occasional status code 404 (not found) responses.

### Using Legacy IDs in Rovi Cloud
If you are using legacy IDs in an existing application, we can configure your Rovi Cloud account so your legacy IDs work in your Rovi Cloud application. Not only that, in your API responses from Rovi Cloud we will include the Rovi Cloud IDs for those legacy IDs so that, over time, you can shift over to using Rovi Cloud IDs.

Here's how it works.

1. When you sign up, ask your account representative to set up your account to accept legacy IDs.
2. As you develop your application, prefix your legacy IDs with the type of ID.
  - For Cosmo IDs for programming sources, prefix your IDs with `source-`, like this: `source-696`.
  - For Cosmo IDs for television services, prefix your IDs with `service-`, like this: `service-898985`.
  - For Cosmo IDs for people, teams, or organizations, prefix your IDs with `celebrity-`, like this: `celebrity-100694`.
  - For Cosmo IDs for programs, movies, series, seasons, episodes, and releases, prefix your IDs with `program-`, like this: `program-19831092`.
  - For iGuide IDs for programs, movies, series, seasons, episodes, and releases, prefix your IDs with `iguide-`, like this: `iguide-4380423`.
3. In API responses from Rovi Cloud, look for the Rovi Cloud ID for each request in a "ref" object. The legacy IDs appear in a "synonyms" object. 

    ```json
    {
      "ref": {
          "id": 915363654,
          "me": "data_series",
          "children": [
             "data_series_awards",
             "data_series_credits",
             "data_series_history",
             "data_series_ratings",
             "data_series_seasons",
             "data_series_synopses",
             "data_content_images"
             "data_source_logos",
          ]
      },
      "synonyms": [
          {
             "program":7914,
             "iguide":7914,
             "in":"en",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":15782587,
             "iguide":15782587,
             "in":"da",
             "title":"Sams Bar"
          },
          {
             "program":15782583,
             "iguide":15782583,
             "in":"de",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":2251538,
             "iguide":2251538,
             "in":"es",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":15782586,
             "iguide":15782586,
             "in":"fr",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":26040460,
             "iguide":4658730,
             "in":"is",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":15782585,
             "iguide":15782585,
             "in":"it",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":15782588,
             "iguide":15782588,
             "in":"nb",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":15782589,
             "iguide":15782589,
             "in":"nl",
             "title":"Cheers"
          },
          {
             "program":21367433,
             "iguide":6278824,
             "in":"sv",
             "title":"Skål!"
          },
          {
             "program":15782584,
             "iguide":15782584,
             "in":"sv-se",
             "title":"Skål"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```
        
4. Grab the Rovi Cloud ID for that request and update your database with that ID for future requests.
5. When you are only using Rovi Cloud IDs, notify your Rovi account representative. We will then modify your templates file to stop sending synonym objects in your API responses.

### Implementing Search and Recommendations
Some Rovi Cloud search and recommendations responses offers a unique feature:  A user can expand an item in a response &mdash; we say "unfold an item" &mdash; and then, if the user wishes, perform another search within the unfolded results.

For example, one of the items in the following sample response is the TV series _Star Trek: Next Generation_. The user can select that item to unfold that item, which, in this case, returns episodes in the series. At this point the user can perform another search on the unfolded content, searching for something in episodes in the series or, of course, page through the results.

The user can continue to unfold items and then perform searches on unfolded items without end. 

We recommend implementing a Back button for search and recommendations, by caching request parameter values and, if possible, responses, so a user can return to a previous response and begin a new search at any point.

It works like this:

1. You offer a search request, for example, discover_all_video_by_search/content.
2. The user searches for "Star Trek." 
  - You push parameter values to a stack.
  - The API returns the response. Here's the response (abbreviated) with the item the user is about to pick:

    ```json
    {
      "ref": {
        "me": "discover_all_video_by_search",
        "sub": "content",
        "query": "star+trek"
      },
      "next": "vp:sc:0~,startrek,1,1444258124,10:10:0;,,,0~~tv~256",
      "size": 10,
      "items": [
        {
          "ref": {
            "id": 913943391,
            "me": "data_series",
            "next": "vp:bm:0~WIKI27070~~tv"
          },
          "in": "en",
          "type": "series",
          "name": "
            <em>Star </em>
            <em>Trek:</em> The Next Generation",
          "year": 1987,
          "runtime": 1800,
          "matched": [
            {
              "field": "name",
              "value": "
                <em>Star </em>
                <em>Trek:</em> The Next Generation"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. The user picks an item in the response, the series _Star Trek: Next Generation_. There are two paths you can take with this item, based on the contents of the __ref__ object for that item:

    ```json
    "ref": {
       "id": 913943391,
       "me": "data_series",
       "next": "vp:bm:0~WIKI27070~~tv"
    }
    ```
  - You can execute a data_series request, using the ID 913943391, thereby exiting search.
  - Or you can stay in search, executing another discover_all_video_by_search/content request using the value of the __next__ field vp:bm:0~WIKI27070~~tv to unfold the item. 
    
4. You copy that value to the __next__ parameter and execute the search request. (You also push the request parameter values to the stack.)
  - Recommendation:  Tag items in a response that have a __next__ field with an icon or text link such as _Search Here_.
  - The API returns information about that item, in this case a list of episodes in that series. Here's the response (abbreviated):
    
    ```json
    {
      "ref": {
        "me": "discover_all_video_by_search",
        "sub": "content",
        "next": "vp:bm:0~WIKI27070~~tv"
      },
      "next": "vp:sc:0~,,1,1444677928,10:10:0;,,,0~~tv",
      "size": 10,
      "context": "1-WIKI27070--1",
      "items": [
        {
          "ref": {
            "id": 913780922,
            "me": "data_episode"
          },
          "in": "en",
          "type": "episode",
          "name": "Brothers",
          "year": 1990,
          "runtime": 3600
        },
        {
          "ref": {
            "id": 914979165,
            "me": "data_episode"
          },
          "in": "en",
          "type": "episode",
          "name": "Symbiosis",
          "year": 1988,
          "runtime": 3600
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
5. The user now searches for "Worf" in those results.
6. Because the response includes a __context__ field, you execute another request using the query value "Worf" and the __context__ value.
  - You also push the parameter values to the stack.
  - The API returns the list of episodes that include the character Worf. Here's the response (abbreviated):

    ```json
    {
      "ref": {
        "me": "discover_all_video_by_search",
        "sub": "content",
        "query": "Worf",
        "context": "1-WIKI27070--1"
      },
      "next": "vp:sc:0~,worf,1,1444678595,10:10:0;,,,0~~tv~256",
      "size": 10,
      "context": "1-WIKI27070--1",
      "items": [
        {
          "ref": {
            "id": 916432494,
            "me": "data_series"
          },
          "in": "en",
          "type": "series",
          "name": "Star Trek: The Next Generation",
          "year": 1987,
          "ratings": {
            "us-tv": "TVPG"
          },
          "runtime": 3600,
          "matched": [
            {
              "field": "Role.name",
              "value": "
                 <em>Worf</em>"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "ref": {
            "id": 915455562,
            "me": "data_episode"
          },
          "in": "en",
          "type": "episode",
          "name": "The Hunted",
          "year": 1990,
          "ratings": {
            "us-tv": "TVPG"
          },
          "runtime": 3600,
          "matched": [
            {
              "field": "role",
              "value": "lt. 
                 <em>worf</em>"
            }
          ]
        }
    }
    ```
7. Note that not every item in a response can be unfolded, just the items that contain a __next__ field in a __ref__ object.

### Boosting API Performance
Using APIs incorrectly can quickly lead to performance issues. Here are a few ways to maximize performance with your design.

#### Execute Multiple Requests at the Same Time
When your app requires data from several API requests, you don’t have to execute each request separately if you have the values for the request arguments. Remember that the Rovi server responds to multiple queries at once. What you can do is execute API calls in parallel, instead of one after another.

Executing requests in parallel reduces overall latency.

Here are a few situations when this can be useful:

- You need to fill out details about a movie or TV program, so you need data from multiple API requests such as data_movie, data_movie_synopses, data_movie_review, data_movie_ratings, and data_movie_credits/cast. The ID is the same for each request, so executing those requests in parallel speeds performance.
- You need a response for each member of a collection, such as channel logos or airing synopsis. In this case, however, we strongly recommend that you request only the data you need for the items that are currently on screen.
- You need data for multiple pages or screens that the user can page up or down through, such as data_service_schedules/screen requests that return data for a TV schedule grid. In this case, request the data for the first screen and then, when that screen is displayed, request all of the other screens in parallel in the background.

#### Execute API Requests in a Separate Thread
If you execute all API requests from the main application flow, you may delay user actions while your application receives API responses and processes data. The Rovi server processes requests extremely fast, but still, your app could occasionally slow down as a result of additional data processing and random factors that impact the connection.

To avoid slowing down the user, you should consider executing some or all API calls in a different thread from the code responsible for displaying the UI. That is especially true when making API requests in the background, such as requests for data the user is likely to page to.

#### Implement a Cache
Another way to speed up API consumption is to store API response data in a temporary cache so that later requests for that data can be served from the cache instead of requested again through the API. There are a couple types of cache, but caching of Rovi data in general is allowed only to the extent specified in your contract with Rovi. Unless specifically authorized, caching is prohibited.

For information about caching of Rovi data, see the following pages here in the Getting Started section:
- [About Cache-Control Response Headers](#introduction/getting-started/about-cache-control-response-headers)
- [Caching Best Practices](#introduction/getting-started/caching-best-practices)

#### Study the API Reference
When you're writing an API request and configuring parameter values, take the time to review the documentation for that request with an eye toward application speed. Can you filter the response data? Can you sort it better? Can you request less data?

It's easy to forget the capabilities of a request. For best results, review the documentation of that request in the Reference section while you're coding it.

## Response Status Codes

The following table shows the typical HTTP status codes from the Rovi Cloud server:

| Code| Description                                    |
|-----|----------------------------------------------- |
| 200 | The server processed the request successfully. |
| 201 | The server processed the request successfully and a new resource was created.  |
| 202 | The server processed the request successfully; the response body is empty. |
| 204 | The server processed the request successfully, but is not returning any content. |
| 400 | Request malformed. Please correct the request per the specification and submit again.  |
| 401 | Request failed OAuth 1.0a authorization. |
| 404 | Requested resource is unavailable: not found, not authorized data, or end-of-list reached. |
| 409 | Request conflict, such as creating a resource that already exists. |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded, per-second or per-UTC-date. Resubmit the request after sufficient time has passed, preferrably using an exponential backoff algorithm to reduce client traffic.  |
| 500 | The server encountered an unexpected error condition.  |
| 503 | The server is temporarily unavailable. |

## Remote Access Error Codes

Rovi Remote Access gives cable subscribers remote access to their cable TV set-top boxes through an application on a tablet, smartphone, or website. This API returns the following error codes:

## About Cache-Control Response Headers
If your contract with Rovi permits caching of Rovi data, you need to decide how to control the duration of cached data, that is, how long you return cached data before you need to refresh it. There are a couple of ways to do that: 1) by using the Cache-Control header fields returned in responses, and 2) by adjusting configuration settings in your cache software.

However you control the duration of cached data, the duration must meet the terms of your contract with Rovi. Cache-Control headers in a response do not authorize caching of Rovi data and do not authorize caching beyond the time allowed by your contract. The purpose of Cache-Control header fields is to give you a ready guideline for your caching. We modify these header values over time as we update our caching algorithms, and we reserve the right to do that at any time. Our caching guidelines are intended to give you the best possible certainty that you have the most current data available.

For guidelines about setting up your cache, please see the section **Caching Best Practices**.

Important: &nbsp; Caching of Rovi data is specifically prohibited unless contractually authorized. If you would like to cache Rovi data for your application, please contact your customer service representative about obtaining authorization.

Requests from the API Console do not return Cache-Control headers, but requests from your application will. Rovi Cloud returns the following cache response headers:

###### Cache-Control: max-age=

This is the number of seconds remaining until more recent data may be available from this request. When that time has elapsed, your cache should perform a new request to Rovi Cloud Services for that data before the cache fulfills additional requests for that data.

###### Cache-Control: must-revalidate

This header tells your cache that it must refresh response data with the Rovi API server, and not an intermediate cache, after data expires and before it fulfills additional requests for the data.

###### Last-Modified

This is the last time the data in the response changed, specified as GMT.

## Caching Best Practices

Caching is the temporary storage of web data so that later requests for that data can be served faster. When you use caching, your application can respond to data requests with data in the cache instead of executing another request for the data from Rovi.
 
If your contract with Rovi allows you to cache data, caching can reduce both your data delivery time and your transaction costs. Caching can also help unify Rovi-provided data under your own domain if you are using a browser-based client that follows the same-origin policy.
 
This section describes best practices for using caching with the Rovi Cloud APIs. We cover the basics of using caching and how to design your Rovi Cloud calls to make the most of your caches.

### Types of Caches
 
We recommend the use of both local and intermediate caches to cache Rovi data:

 +   A local cache is a cache that is located on the same box or device as your application.
 +   An intermediate cache is a cache that is located between your clients and Rovi Cloud.

#### Local Cache

A local cache is a cache that is located on the same box or device as your application.

We recommend making use of a local cache for each client in order to hold, and perhaps even prefetch, data for the customer. Using a local cache, you can ensure that whenever your customer reviews data they previously requested, the data can be displayed instantly without requiring another request back to the cloud. 

We recommend that you keep a local cache of all data immediately relevant to the end user. 

The local cache represents the best value to the customer, but local caches are often limited in size and so may not hold all of the data a customer might ask for. Because of this, we also recommend using an intermediate cache as described next. 

#### Intermediate Caches

In addition to local caches, we recommend using an intermediate cache between your clients and Rovi Cloud. There are typically two forms of intermediate caches you can use: Reverse Proxy Gateways and Content Delivery Networks.

<center><img src="http://dev-widgetads-origin.rovicorp.com/AdGraphics/Condor/API_Console/TwoCacheTypes.png" alt="Two Types of Intermediate Caches" width="349"></center>

###### Reverse Proxy Gateway Cache

A reverse proxy gateway cache can take the form of a set of off-the-shelf HTTP caching servers (such as Squid, Apache, or Varnish) that clients call back through. The proxy cache mediates all communication between your customers and Rovi Cloud, and caches responses from Rovi Cloud. The proxy cache is shared across your customers, and so can serve previously requested data to all of your customers without needing to hit Rovi Cloud for your most commonly requested data. 

From a network topology perspective, you are routing clients through your proxy cache, which places your proxy cache location at the center of your clients' routes to obtain data from Rovi Cloud. This may work well if your cache is centrally located, but may pose additional latency if some of your customers are far from that location. You can, of course, set up multiple proxy locations, and route your clients to the nearest cache, but each proxy cache will then act as an independent cache. 

Using the proxy cache, you control how much infrastructure to deploy, and you don't have to pay a monthly fee (there are many open-source HTTP caching servers that run on Linux). A proxy cache can be as simple as a single server, or as complex as a tier of interconnected servers. If you do wish to employ more than one machine, we recommend a tiered approach of a single Alpha cache that is fronted by N independent Beta caches.

<center><img src="http://dev-widgetads-origin.rovicorp.com/AdGraphics/Condor/API_Console/ProxyCaches.png" alt="Proxy Caches" width="434"></center>

An Alpha cache works as the primary cache: when any customer requests Rovi Cloud data, the data is added to the primary cache and becomes available to all other users. But a single Alpha cache may have trouble keeping up with load and represents a single point of failure. To mitigate this, place N Beta cache servers in front of the Alpha cache, and use a load balancer to distribute requests to the Betas. Client requests then go to one of the Betas, which in turn will go to the Alpha if the Beta does not have the content. Rovi Cloud will then be called only if the Alpha server does not have the content. Over time, all of the cached data in the Alpha will be promoted up to the Betas, and you will have a lot more redundancy in case one or more of your servers goes down. 

###### Content Delivery Network Cache

As an alternative to setting up your own proxy cache, you can pay a Content Delivery Network (CDN), such as Akamai or Limelight, to act as a proxy cache for you. This is known as "caching as a service." CDNs typically charge for the amount of traffic they proxy. 

The main benefit to using a CDN is that it edges out content close to your clients, which reduces the latency for your clients if they are geographically distributed. Generally speaking, your customers may get greater benefit from a CDN, but a CDN may cost more than standing up your own proxy cache.         

###### Unifying Your Domain for HTML5 Applications

Both forms of intermediate caches provide an additional benefit: they can redistribute Rovi Cloud data under your own domain. Why would you want to do that? Because browser-based HTML5 applications follow a same-origin policy: the HTML page and the JSON data received through AJAX calls must originate from the same domain. Since you can expose the cache under your domain, you can use the cache to unify Rovi data under your own domain. Very often, HTML5 applications make use of a CDN anyway, to accelerate the HTML, Javascript, and media portions of the application. Leveraging your CDN to also accelerate Rovi Cloud data solves all of those problems at once. 

<center><img src="http://dev-widgetads-origin.rovicorp.com/AdGraphics/Condor/API_Console/unified-cdn.png" alt="Unifying Your Domain for HTML5 Applications" width="364"></center>

### Cache Directives

When you set up a cache, you need to decide how to control the duration of cached data, that is, how long you return cached data before you need to refresh it. There are a couple of ways to do that: 1) by using the Cache-Control header fields returned in responses, and 2) by configuration settings in your cache software.

However you control the duration of cached data, the duration must meet the terms of your contract with Rovi. 

#### Cache-Control Headers

Rovi includes standard HTTP 1.1 Cache-Control header fields in API responses. These header fields represent our best estimate of how long you should store data in order to obtain the best trade-off between cache reuse and data freshness. 

By providing Cache-Control header fields, Rovi can optimize the Time To Live (TTL) directives of different content in order to maximize this trade-off. For example, if we know that the data for a particular response is unlikely to change, we can set a long TTL; while more volatile data may be given a shorter TTL. 

Cache-Control header fields give you a ready guideline for your caching. We will modify these header values over time as we update our caching algorithms, and we reserve the right to do that at any time. 

Note: Your use of Cache-Control header fields, like your use of caching in general, is subject to the terms of your contract with Rovi. Cache-Control header fields do not authorize any use of caching that is not permitted by the terms of your contract. 

#### Managed Cache Configuration

Alternatively, if your contract with Rovi permits caching, you can also choose to ignore the Cache-Control header fields and configure your cache so it caches content in a different manner, in accordance with your contract with Rovi. Exactly what right you have to cache, if any, is determined by your contract with Rovi. 

You may, for example, have the right to cache Rovi data for up to 12 hours. In this case, you can configure your caches to cache data for up to 12 hours, regardless of any cache control headers in the responses. Most caches, both local and in the cloud, allow you to configure the cache directives directly.

#### Using ETags to Check Whether a Response Has Changed

Rovi sends an ETag (entity tag) header value with every response. That ETag value remains the same until the response changes. What can you do with that? You can check anytime whether a response has changed by sending the same request with an If-None-Match header that includes that ETag value. If the response has not changed, Rovi returns a 304 status code, Not Modified, and no data.

Here's a sample ETag in a response header:

ETag:"0faab13e3a16cd1f3838c49536d531be4"

Here's a sample request header, using that ETag:

`If-None-Match: "0faab13e3a16cd1f3838c49536d531be4"`

Note that the quotes are part of the ETag.

Using ETags verifies the freshness of the data and reduces network traffic. If the data has changed, Rovi sends the fresh response.

Either way, sending a request with an If-None-Match header restarts your cache clock. But, like every request, it does count against your throttling limits.

#### Using Data_Delta Requests to Update Cached Data

Another way to keep your cached data up to date is to regularly get IDs of data that changed and to update the cache with that data. Rovi Cloud offers the data_delta requests for this purpose.

The data_delta requests return IDs and ETags for response data that changed during a single UTC date one to four days ago.

Call the data_delta requests on a regular schedule, say every one to four days. Then use those IDs to update your cache with the changed response data. If you use ETags, use the corresponding ETag for each ID to check whether the data has already been updated in the cache.

Rovi Cloud currently offers the following data_delta requests. We will be adding more soon.

| Data Request | Corresponding Data_Delta Request |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie)       | [data_delta_movie](/#reference/movie/datadeltamovie) |
| [data_series](/#reference/series/dataseries)    | [data_delta_series](/#reference/series/datadeltaseries) |
| [data_season](/#reference/season/dataseason)    | [data_delta_season](/#reference/season/datadeltaseason) |
| [data_episode](/#reference/episode/dataepisode) | [data_delta_episode](/#reference/episode/datadeltaepisode) |
| [data_other](/#reference/other/dataother)       | [data_delta_other](/#reference/other/datadeltaother) |
| [data_person](/#reference/person/dataperson)    | [data_delta_person](/#reference/person/datadeltaperson) |

### Preparing Your Caches

There are a few things to consider up front to ensure that you will be able to make the most use of your local and shared caches. Some of these relate to how your caches are configured, while others relate to the expected traffic patterns of your clients. 

#### Cache Configuration

Here's some advice about configuring your caches.

###### Pay Attention to Query String Parameters

In general, you need to configure your cache to pay attention to query string parameters. Query string parameters are request parameters that come after the question mark in the URI and take the form of parameter=value, such as country=CA. The Rovi Cloud API passes most request parameters as query strings, so the cache needs to use those parameters to distinguish requests.

###### Retry 403 Over-Per-Second Responses

There is one error message that both your local and intermediate cache should watch for. This is the error message from the Rovi API hosting service that tells you that the maximum number of requests you are contractually allowed during one second have already been received: 

`403 Account Over Queries Per Second Limit`

Because this error message indicates a temporary limit of one second, simply retrying the request from your intermediate cache gives you a faster way of resolving the problem than relaying the message back to the client to try again. We recommend using an exponential backoff algorithm for retrying these requests. 

In addition, we strongly recommend that this retry logic also be implemented by your client in case the intermediate cache is down or gives up, and the error message does make it back to your client. 

Other 403 error messages, such as Forbidden, should NOT be handled in the same way. Those error messages represent real problems that are not resolvable with a simple retry. 

#### Sharp-Onset Traffic Spikes

It sounds simple: When you have an intermediate cache, one client requests some data, the data gets added the cache, and so when the next group of clients request that same data, the data is already in the cache. 

But there is one situation that circumvents an intermediate cache: a large number of clients all making the same initial request at once. The response doesn't make it into the cache because they all hit at once, so the requests all go to Rovi Cloud and perhaps hit your transaction-per-second limit. 

The solution is to employ logic that discourages a large number of clients from all making that initial request at the same time. This section describes two ways to do that. 

###### Randomize Automated Download Times Across Clients

One reason that traffic spikes can occur is synchronization of clients. If, for example, your client expects to download listings data every hour, it might be configured to download that data exactly on the hour. If that happens, every client you have will try to request their data at the top of the hour, which will create a sharp-onset traffic spike. 

You should take steps to ensure that your clients are as unsynchronized as possible. If you are downloading data asynchronously, we recommend finding ways to randomize the timing of your clients so that their requests are uniformly distributed. 

###### Warm the Cache Before Spikes

Another reason traffic spikes can occur is synchronization of humans. This commonly happens because an event such as a series finale or a sporting event is about to start. 

If you have reason to believe that people are creating sharp-onset traffic spikes, one possible mitigation is to warm your cache ahead of the spike by running a script to request the most-likely Rovi Cloud requests through your cache. That script does not have to live on your clients. That script can originate from anywhere, as long as it calls through the same cache as your clients. 

### Preparing Requests

The key to optimizing your caches, especially shared caches, is to design your client so that all clients use common URIs for common requests. Ideally, you want your clients in the field to use as few unique URIs as possible. Therefore you need to look carefully at how you construct your requests to Rovi Cloud so you encourage high cache hit rates through the URIs and traffic patterns you create.

#### Try to Constrain Variables

The first step is to look carefully at the calls you will be making and to constrain as many parameters to as few values as possible. Ideally, you want most of the parameters on the call to have fixed values that are universally applicable to all of your clients. For those parameters that can't be fixed, try to limit them to as few values as possible. 

You may find that some parameters have the same value for all calls, such as **country** and **language**. This means that the actual hit rate for a particular call will be determined mainly by the combination of values in other parameters. 

#### Create Requests the Same Way Every Time

Naturally, you should make sure that your clients all create a URI in the same way when they are making the same request. Most caches will ignore the order of query string parameters, but keeping the same order may make the cache even more efficient. The best way to accomplish that is to build requests from the URI templates in your templates file.

Avoid making a call that is a subset of a previous call. If the response data is in the cache, it would be better to get that data and use just the data you need. For example, if your client makes a call for upcoming local broadcasts in the comedy genre with discover_all_video_by_genre/content, it may be unnecessary to make a second request for movies in the same genre because the response to the first request includes movies. Just make the request for content, even if the client sometimes ignores the movies. That way the cache would be filled with the data and the subsequent request would find it in the cache.

# Group Search
The Search requests search for titles of movies and TV shows relevant to the search query and return results in order of relevance and popularity. The Search requests offer two groups of requests, one of which limits results to the user's local television listings:
+ Titles (the __discover_all_video_by_conversation__ and __discover_all_video_by_search__ requests)
+ Titles that are in the local television schedule (the __discover_available_video_by_conversation__ and __discover_available_video_by_search__ requests)

To return local TV listings in responses, requests must include the service ID of the user's local television service. You can get the service ID for a local television service from the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.

# discover_all_video_by_conversation/content [/discover_all_video_by_conversation/content?query={query}&lineupId={lineupId}&context={context}]

# data_service [/data_service/{id}]
Returns information about a television service.

## GET
This request requires the `data_service` ID for the television service, which is returned in a [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) response.

Rovi also provides US national television listings for the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources. So if you want to provide US national listings, use the following `data_service` IDs:
* 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
* 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
* 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned in a [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) response.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_service_channels/bulk [/data_service_channels/bulk?id={id}&page={page}] 
Returns channel information for a television service at 50 channels per request, to be used asynchronously in the background to fill a local store.

**Design Note:** &nbsp; Partner this request with [data_service_schedules/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesbulk). For each page of channel data you get here, request the same page number of TV listings there. If your contract with Rovi allows caching, we recommend caching channel data locally and updating TV listings as needed during the session.

*This request returns a large amount of data and is not intended to be displayed all at once for a waiting user. For fast responses for immediate display, use the /single or /screen request instead.*

## GET
This request requires the `data_service_channels` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_channels` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.

For US national television listings, however, use the following IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone
 
+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service_channels` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_channels` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number of the list to return. The first page contains information about the first 50 channels in the channel list, the second page contains information about channels 51 to 100 in the list, and so on. These are not channel numbers, but rather serve as an index of channels within the lineup. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

# data_service_channels/screen [/data_service_channels/screen?id={id}&page={page}] 
Returns channel information for a television service at 10 channels per request. 

**Design Note:** &nbsp; Partner this request with [data_service_schedules/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesscreen). For each page of channel data you get here, request the same page number of TV listings there. If your contract with Rovi allows caching, we recommend caching channel data locally and updating TV listings as needed during the session.

## GET 
This request requires the `data_service_channels` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_channels` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service_channels` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service_channels` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_channels` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number of the list to return. The first page contains information about the first 10 channels in the channel list, the second page contains information about channels 11 to 20 in the list, and so on. These are not channel numbers, but rather serve as an index of channels within the lineup. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

# data_service_channels/single [/data_service_channels/single?id={id}&page={page}]  
Returns channel information for a television service at one channel per request. Use this request to present information for a single channel in linear form, instead of a grid.

**Design Note:** &nbsp; Partner this request with [data_service_schedules/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulessingle). For each page of channel data you get here, request the same page number of TV listings there. If your contract with Rovi allows caching, we recommend caching channel data locally and updating TV listings as needed during the session.

## GET 
This request requires the `data_service_channels` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_channels` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service_channels` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service_channels` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_channels` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number of the list to return. The first page contains information about the first channel in the channel list, the second page contains information about the second channel in the list, and so on. These are not channel numbers, but rather serve as an index of channels within the lineup. A page number greater than the number of channels returns status code 404.

# data_service_schedules/bulk [/data_service_schedules/bulk?id={id}&date={date}&block={block}&page={page}] 
Returns six hours of TV listings for a television service, at 50 channels per request, to be used asynchronously in the background to fill a local store.  Language of program titles is determined by the broadcast source.

**Design Note:** &nbsp; Partner this request with [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk). For each page of channel data you get there, request the same page number of TV listings here. If your contract with Rovi allows caching, we recommend caching channel data locally and updating TV listings as needed during the session.

*This request returns a large amount of data and is not intended to be displayed all at once for a waiting user. For fast responses for immediate display, use the /single or /screen request instead.*
 
## GET
This request requires the `data_service_schedules` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_schedules` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service_schedules` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service_schedules` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_schedules` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})
    UTC date of the TV listings you want, from the current UTC date up to a date two weeks in the future, in YYYY-MM-DD format. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
    <br> &emsp; **Note:**  When local daylight savings time begins and ends, the UTC offset also changes. You need to change time labels when those events occur and, if you want to maintain the same local time segments, make a second call for the next UTC time segment.
  + block (required, integer from 1 to 4, `1`)
    Which six-hour time segment of the day to return, from 1 to 4. The time segments correspond to UTC starting times of 12:00AM, 6:00AM, 12:00PM, and 6:00PM.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number of the list to return. The first page contains TV listings for the first 50 channels in the channel list, the second page contains channels 51 to 100 in the list, and so on. These are not channel numbers, but rather serve as an index of channels within the lineup. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

# data_service_schedules/screen [/data_service_schedules/screen?id={id}&date={date}&block={block}&page={page}] 
Returns four hours of TV listings for a television service, at 10 channels per request. Increment the page number in successive requests to return TV listings for all of the channels offered by the television service. Language of program titles is determined by the broadcast source.

**Design Note:** &nbsp; Partner this request with [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelscreen). For each page of channel data you get there, request the same page number of TV listings here. If your contract with Rovi allows caching, we recommend caching channel data locally and updating TV listings as needed during the session.

## GET
This request requires the `data_service_schedules` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_schedules` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service_schedules` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service_schedules` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_schedules` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})
    UTC date of the TV listings you want, from the current UTC date up to a date two weeks in the future, in YYYY-MM-DD format. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
    <br> &emsp; **Note:**  When local daylight savings time begins and ends, the UTC offset also changes. You need to change time labels when those events occur and, if you want to maintain the same local time segments, make a second call for the next UTC time segment.
  + block (required, integer from 1 to 6, `1`)
    Which four-hour time segment of the day to return, from 1 to 6. The time segments correspond to UTC starting times of 12:00AM, 4:00AM, 8:00AM, 12:00PM, 4:00PM, and 8:00PM.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number of the list to return. The first page contains TV listings for the first 10 channels in the channel list, the second page contains channels 11 to 20 in the list, and so on. These are not channel numbers, but rather serve as an index of channels within the lineup. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

# data_service_schedules/single [/data_service_schedules/single?id={id}&date={date}&page={page}] 
Returns one day of TV listings for a television service, at one channel per request.  Use this request to present information for a single channel in linear form, instead of a grid. Language of program titles is determined by the broadcast source.

**Design Note:** &nbsp; Partner this request with [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle). For each page of channel data you get there, request the same page number of TV listings here. If your contract with Rovi allows caching, we recommend caching channel data locally and updating TV listings as needed during the session.
 
## GET
This request requires the `data_service_schedules` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_schedules` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service_schedules` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service_schedules` ID for the television service, which is returned as a link in responses to a [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice) or [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request. A `data_service_schedules` ID for a television service is the same as the `data_service` ID.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})
    UTC date of the TV listings you want, from the current UTC date up to a date two weeks in the future, in YYYY-MM-DD format. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
    <br> &emsp; **Note:**  When local daylight savings time begins and ends, the UTC offset also changes. You need to change time labels when those events occur and, if you want to maintain the same local time segments, make a second call for the next UTC time segment.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number of the list to return. The first page contains TV listings for the first channel in the channel list, the second page contains the second channel in the channel list, and so on. These are not channel numbers, but rather serve as an index of channels within the lineup. A page number greater than the number of available channels returns status code 404.

# data_source_airings/single [/data_source_airings/single?id={id}&date={date}] 
Returns a 24-hour broadcast schedule for a source of programming on a television channel.

## GET 
This request requires the `data_source` ID for source of programming on the TV channel, which is returned in responses to the following requests:
+ [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasairing)
+ [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)
+ [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
+ [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen)
+ [data_series_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataseriesappearances)
+ [data_movie_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/datamovieappearances)
+ [data_other_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataotherappearances)
+ [data_episode_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataepisodeappearances)

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `69049209`)
    The `data_source` ID for the TV channel, which is returned in responses to the following requests:
      + [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasairing)
      + [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)
      + [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
      + [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen)
      + [data_series_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataseriesappearances)
      + [data_movie_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/datamovieappearances)
      + [data_other_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataotherappearances)
      + [data_episode_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataepisodeappearances)
      
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}, `2015-08-30`)
    UTC date of the schedule, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time. Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times. The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice).

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_movie_appearances [/data_movie_appearances?id={id}&serviceId={serviceId}&date={date}&page={page}] 
Returns a schedule of local television broadcasts of a movie.

Execute this request if the user wants local broadcast times for a movie title returned by one of the availability requests:
+ [discover_available_similar_video/movie](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideomovie)
+ [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_search/movie](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchmovie)
+ [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_genre/movie](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenremovie)
+ [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)

## GET
This request requires the following IDs:
+ The `data_service` ID of the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
+ The `data_movie_appearances` ID, returned by a response to the availability request. A `data_movie_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914511209`)
    The `data_movie_appearances` ID for the movie, which is returned by the following availability requests.  A `data_movie_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
     + [discover_available_similar_video/movie](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideomovie)
     + [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_search/movie](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchmovie)
     + [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_genre/movie](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenremovie)
     + [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)
     
  + serviceId (required, integer, `528503608`)
    The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}, `2015-08-28`)
    UTC date the schedule begins, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format. The returned schedule covers up to two weeks from the current date. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_series_appearances [/data_series_appearances?id={id}&serviceId={serviceId}&date={date}&page={page}] 
Returns a schedule of local television broadcasts of a TV series.

Execute this request if the user wants local broadcast times for a TV series title returned by one of the availability requests:
+ [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_genre/series](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenreseries)
+ [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)

## GET
This request requires the following IDs:
+ The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
+ The `data_series_appearances` ID, returned by a response to the availability request. A `data_series_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_series` ID for the series.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `916247613`)
    The `data_series_appearances` ID for the TV series, which is returned by the following availability requests.  A `data_series_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_series` ID for the series.
     + [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_genre/series](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenreseries)
     + [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)
     
  + serviceId (required, integer, `528503608`)
    The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}, `2015-08-28`)
    UTC date the schedule begins, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format. The returned schedule covers up to two weeks from the current date. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_episode_appearances [/data_episode_appearances?id={id}&serviceId={serviceId}&date={date}&page={page}] 
Returns a schedule of local television broadcasts of an epidsode in a TV series.

Execute this request if the user wants local broadcast times for an episode title returned by one of the availability requests:
+ [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
+ [discover_available_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablebygenre/content)

## GET
This request requires the following IDs:
+ The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
+ The `data_episode_appearances` ID, returned by a response to the availability request. A `data_episode_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_episode` ID for the episode.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1443670807`)
    The `data_episode_appearances` ID for an episode in a TV series, which is returned by the following availability requests. A `data_episode_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_episode` ID for the episode.
     + [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)
     
  + serviceId (required, integer, `528503608`)
    The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}, `2015-08-28`)
    UTC date the schedule begins, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format. The returned schedule covers up to two weeks from the current date. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_other_appearances [/data_other_appearances?id={id}&serviceId={serviceId}&date={date}&page={page}] 
Returns a schedule of local television broadcasts of a TV program that is not a movie or TV series.

Execute this request if the user wants local broadcast times for a program title returned by one of the availability requests:
+ [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
+ [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)

## GET
This request requires the following IDs:
+ The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
+ The `data_other_appearances` ID, returned by a response to the availability request. A `data_other_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_other` ID for the program.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `1546068448`)
    The `data_other_appearances` ID for a TV program that is not a movie or TV series, returned by the following availability requests. A `data_other_appearances` ID is the same as the `data_other` ID for the program.
     + [discover_available_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoveravailablesimilarvideocontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobysearchcontent)
     + [discover_available_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoveravailablevideobygenrecontent)
     
  + serviceId (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}, `2015-08-28`)
    UTC date the schedule begins, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format. The returned schedule covers up to two weeks from the current date. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_person_appearances [/data_person_appearances?id={id}&serviceId={serviceId}&date={date}&page={page}] 
Returns a schedule of local television broadcast appearances of a person.

## GET
This request requires the following IDs:
+ The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
+ The `data_person` ID for the person, returned by responses to the _credits requests.

For US national television listings, however, use the following `data_service` IDs. These listings do not include channel numbers because they cover an entire time zone, but local viewers generally know the channels for these sources, which are the most popular national broadcast and cable sources, like HBO, CNBC, and CSPAN.
+ 341759807 — US Eastern Time Zone
+ 341759808 — US Central Time Zone
+ 341759810 — US Pacific Time Zone

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `6779289`)
    The `data_person` ID for the person, returned in responses to the following requests:
     + [data_airing_credits](/#reference/tv-and-movie-data/dataairingcreditscast)
     + [data_movie_credits](/#reference/movie/datamoviecreditscast)
     + [data_series_credits](/#reference/series/dataseriescreditscast)
     + [data_other_credits](/#reference/other/dataothercreditscast)
     
  + serviceId (required, integer, `1063353154`)
    The `data_service` ID for the television service, returned by a response to the [data_browse_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/databrowseservice) request.
  + date (required, string matching \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}, `2015-08-28`)
    UTC date the schedule begins, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format. The returned schedule covers up to two weeks from the current date. To determine the local time that a UTC date starts, add the local UTC offset to 12:00AM. For example, for San Francisco, with a UTC offset of -420 minutes during daylight savings time, the UTC date begins at 5:00PM local time.
    <br> &emsp; The UTC offset for a television service is returned by [data_service](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservice). Because program times are returned in UTC, you also use the local UTC offset to calculate local program dates and times.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_airing_credits/cast [/data_airing_credits/cast?id={id}&page={page}&by={by}] 
Returns cast credits for a program in a current broadcast schedule.

## GET
This request requires the `data_airing_credits` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, which is returned in response to a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request. A `data_airing_credits` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for the program and expires when the program disappears from the current broadcast schedule.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer)
    The `data_airing_credits` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, which is returned in response to a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request. A `data_airing_credits` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for the program and expires when the program disappears from the current broadcast schedule.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + by (optional, string, `role`)
    Response field or object.field to sort by. Child fields must be single-valued, that is, not within an array.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __role__ or __person.alts.last__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: __-role__.
      +  To start with items that contain a particular field, replace {by} with a field-equals-not-null, like this: __person.image=!null__. To start with items that are missing a particular field, specify a field-equals-null, like this: __person.image=null__. 
      +  To start with items that contain a particular value in a top-level field, replace {by} with field-equals-value, like this: __role=Tony Stark__. To end with items that contain a particular value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __role=!Tony Stark__.
      +  Combine alpha and numeric sorts in a comma-separated list in left-to-right priority.
      
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_airing_credits/crew [/data_airing_credits/crew?id={id}&page={page}&by={by}] 
Returns crew credits for a program in a current broadcast schedule.

## GET
This request requires the `data_airing_credits` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, which is returned in response to a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request. A `data_airing_credits` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for the program and expires when the program disappears from the current broadcast schedule.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer)
    The `data_airing_credits` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, which is returned in response to a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request. A `data_airing_credits` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for the program and expires when the program disappears from the current broadcast schedule.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + by (optional, string, `type`)
    Response field or object.field to sort by. Child fields must be single-valued, that is, not within an array.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __credit__ or __person.alts.last__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: __-credit__.
      +  To start with items that contain a particular field, replace {by} with a field-equals-not-null, like this: __person.image=!null__. To start with items that are missing a particular field, specify a field-equals-null, like this: __type=null__. 
      +  To start with items that contain a particular value in a top-level field, replace {by} with field-equals-value, like this: __type=director__. To end with items that contain a particular value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __type=!company__.
      +  Combine alpha and numeric sorts in a comma-separated list in left-to-right priority.
    
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_airing_credits/credits [/data_airing_credits/credits?id={id}&page={page}&by={by}] 
Returns both cast and crew credits for a program in a current broadcast schedule.

## GET
This request requires the `data_airing_credits` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, which is returned in response to a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request. A `data_airing_credits` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for the program and expires when the program disappears from the current broadcast schedule.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer)
    The `data_airing_credits` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, which is returned in response to a [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing) request. A `data_airing_credits` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for the program and expires when the program disappears from the current broadcast schedule.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + by (optional, string, `credit`)
    Response field or object.field to sort by. Child fields must be single-valued, that is, not within an array.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __credit__ or __person.alts.last__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) like this: __-credit__.
      +  To start with items that contain a particular field, replace {by} with field-equals-not-null, like this: __person.image=!null__. To start with items that are missing a particular field, specify field-equals-null, like this: __role=null__. 
      +  To start with items that contain a particular value in a top-level field, replace {by} with field-equals-value, like this: __type=director__. To end with items that contain a particular value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __type=!company__.
      +  Combine alpha and numeric sorts in a comma-separated list in left-to-right priority.
    
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_airing_synopses/collection [/data_airing_synopses/collection?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns a range of synopses for a program in a current broadcast schedule.

## GET
This request requires the `data_airing_synopses` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, returned in responses to the following requests. (Note:  A `data_airing_synopses` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for a program and expires when the program disappears from the broadcast schedule.)

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer)
    The `data_airing_synopses` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, returned in responses to the following requests. Note:  A `data_airing_synopses` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for a program and expires when the program disappears from the broadcast schedule.

      +  [data_service_schedules/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesscreen)
    
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

# data_airing_synopses/best [/data_airing_synopses/best?id={id}&length={length}&length2={length2}&length3={length3}&length4={length4}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns the best available synopsis of a program in a current broadcast schedule, based on type:
+  `long` &mdash; Straightforward, objective description of the program in up to 420 characters.
+  `short` &mdash; A shorter version of the "long" description.
+  `plain` &mdash; A straightforward description without credits that is never critical.
+  `extended` &mdash; A more detailed description than the "long" description, up to 2000 characters.

## GET
This request requires the `data_airing_synopses` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, returned in responses to the following requests. (Note:  A `data_airing_synopses` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for a program and expires when the program disappears from the broadcast schedule.)
+  [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing)
+  [data_movie_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/datamovieappearances)
+  [data_series_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataseriesappearances)
+  [data_episode_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataepisodeappearances)

+  [data_service_schedules/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesscreen)

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer)
    The `data_airing_synopses` ID for a program in a current broadcast schedule, returned in responses to the following requests. Note:  A `data_airing_synopses` ID is the same as the `data_airing` ID for a program and expires when the program disappears from the broadcast schedule.

      +  [data_service_schedules/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataserviceschedulesscreen)
      
  + length (required, string enum, `short`)
    First choice for type of description:
    <table>
    <tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>long</td><td><p>Straightforward, objective description of the program in up to 420 characters.</p></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>short</td><td><p>A shorter version of the "long" description.</p></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>plain</td><td><p>A straightforward description without credits that is never critical.</p></td>
    </tr><tr>
    <td>extended</td><td><p>A more detailed description than the "long" description, up to 2000 characters.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
  + length2 (optional, string enum, `long`)
    Second choice for type of description.
  + length3 (optional, string enum, `plain`)
    Third choice for type of description.
  + length4 (optional, string enum, `extended`)
    Fourth choice for type of description.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
     
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# Group Image
This section documents the calls that return images and image metadata for shows, releases, people, and channel logos.

To review, let's summarize the procedures for returning images as described in the section [About Our APIs](http://docs.rovicloudapi.apiary.io/#introduction/about-our-apis).

__To Get Channel Logos__

There are two paths to a channel logo.

If you want the standard logo for a channel as returned by a [data_service_channels](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk) response, just grab the `media_logo` ID there and call [media_logo](/#reference/image/medialogo) to select the size and get the logo file.

If you want a different logo, follow these steps:
+ Grab the `data_source_logos` ID for the channel from the [data_service_channels](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk) response.
+ Then EITHER call [data_source_logos/collection](/#reference/image/datasourcelogoscollection) to return a list of the logos available and select the `media_logo` ID of the logo you want.
+ OR call [data_source_logos/best](/#reference/image/datasourcelogosbest) to return the `media_logo` ID of the best logo as determined by five possible filters.
+ Finally, when you have the `media_logo` ID, call [media_logo](/#reference/image/medialogo) to select the size and get the logo file.

__To Get Images for a Movie, Series, Season, Episode, or Other Show__

There are two paths to an image for a movie, series, season, episode, or other show. 

If you want the image that a response recommends, just grab the `media_image` ID there in the response and either call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to select the size and get the image file or call [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to get the original image file.

If you want another image, follow these steps:
+ Grab the `data_content_images` ID from the response.
+ Then EITHER call [data_content_images/collection](/#reference/image/datacontentimagescollection) to return a list of the available images and select the `media_image` ID of the image you want.
+ OR call [data_content_images/best](/#reference/image/datacontentimagesbest) to return the `media_image` ID of the best image as determined by five possible filters.
+ Finally, EITHER call [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to return the original image file.
+ OR call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to return the image file in the size you want.

__To Get Images for a Release of a Movie, Episode, or Other Show__

There are two paths to an image for a release of a movie, episode, or other show. 

If you want the image that a response recommends, just grab the `media_image` ID there in the response and either call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to select the size and get the image file or call [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to get the original image file.

If you want another image, follow these steps:
+ Grab the `data_release_images` ID from the response (that ID is the same as the `data_release` ID).
+ Then EITHER call [data_release_images/collection](/#reference/image/datareleaseimagescollection) to return a list of the available images and select the `media_image` ID of the image you want.
+ OR call [data_release_images/best](/#reference/image/datareleaseimagesbest) to return the `media_image` ID of the best image as determined by five possible filters.
+ Finally, EITHER call [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to return the original image file.
+ OR call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to return the image file in the size you want.

__To Get Images of a Person__

There are two paths to an image of a person. Both paths include premium celebrity images if your subscription allows access to those images.

If you want the image that a response recommends, just grab the `media_image` ID there in the response and either call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to select the size and get the image file or call [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to get the original image file.

If you want another image, follow these steps:
+ Grab the `data_name_images` ID from the response.
+ Then EITHER call [data_name_images/collection](/#reference/image/datanameimagescollection) to return a list of the available images and select the `media_image` ID of the image you want.
+ OR call [data_name_images/best](/#reference/image/datanameimagesbest) to return the `media_image` ID of the best image as determined by five possible filters.
+ Finally, EITHER call [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster) to return the original image file.
+ OR call [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized) to return the image file in the size you want.

# data_source_logos/collection [/data_source_logos/collection?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}&page={page}] 
Returns metadata about the available logos for a TV channel.

To deliver a logo specified by the response to this request, grab the `media_logo ID` for that logo and then call [media_logo](/#reference/image/medialogo).

## GET
This request requires the `data_source_logos` ID for the source of programming on the channel, which is returned by the following requests. A `data_source_logos` ID for a source is the same as the `data_source` ID.
+ [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource)
+ [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)
+ [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
+ [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen)

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `69047095`)
    The `data_source_logos` ID for the source of programming on the channel, which is returned by the following requests. A `data_source_logos` ID for a source is the same as the `data_source` ID.
      + [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource)
      + [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)
      + [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
      + [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen)

  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

Returns metadata about the best logo for each of up to three TV channels, as determined by five possible image metadata filters.

To deliver a logo specified by the response to this request, grab the `media_logo ID` for that logo and then call [media_logo](/#reference/image/medialogo).

## GET
This request requires the `data_source_logos` ID for the source of programming on the channel, which is returned by the following requests. A `data_source_logos` ID for a source is the same as the `data_source` ID.
+ [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource)
+ [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)
+ [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
+ [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen)

Note: When specifying more than one `data_source_logos` ID, specify the IDs in ascending numerical order.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `69047711`)
    The `data_source_logos` ID for the source of programming on the channel, which is returned by the following requests. A `data_source_logos` ID for a source is the same as the `data_source` ID.
      + [data_source](/#reference/tv-schedule/datasource)
      + [data_service_channels/bulk](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsbulk)
      + [data_service_channels/single](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelssingle)
      + [data_service_channels/screen](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataservicechannelsscreen)
    
  + id2 (optional, integer, `69048687`)
    The `data_source_logos` ID for a second TV channel. This ID must be greater than the value of {id}.
  + id3 (optional, integer, `69049209`)
    The `data_source_logos` ID for a third TV channel. This ID must be greater than the value of {id2}.
  + by (optional, string, `id`)
    Response field to sort by. Only top-level response fields are valid, not objects or fields in objects.
     +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: *id*. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: *-id*.
     +  To insert a value at the top of the sort, replace {by} with the field and value, like this: "caption=122x66; black".
     +  To filter out a value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: "caption=!122x66; black".

  + by2 (optional, string, `caption`)
    Second level sort specification.
  + by3 (optional, string, `type`)
    Third level sort specification.
  + by4 (optional, string, `type`)
    Fourth level sort specification.
  + by5 (optional, string, `type`)
    Fifth level sort specification.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

# data_content_images/collection [/data_content_images/collection?id={id}&page={page}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns metadata about the images available for an airing, movie, series, season, episode, or other.

To deliver an image specified in the response, grab the `media_image` ID for the image you want from the response and then call one of these requests:
+ [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized)
+ [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster)

## GET 
This request requires a `data_content_images` ID, which is returned in links in responses to the following requests. A `data_content_images` ID is the same as the ID for each of these requests.
+  [data_other](/#reference/other/dataother)
+  [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing)
+  [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie)
+  [data_series](/#reference/series/dataseries)
+  [data_season](/#reference/season/dataseason)
+  [data_episode](/#reference/episode/dataepisode)

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    A `data_content_images` ID, returned in responses to the following requests:
      +  [data_other](/#reference/other/dataother)
      +  [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing)
      +  [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie)
      +  [data_series](/#reference/series/dataseries)
      +  [data_season](/#reference/season/dataseason)
      +  [data_episode](/#reference/episode/dataepisode)
      
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_content_images/best [/data_content_images/best?id={id}&id2={id2}&id3={id3}&by={by}&by2={by2}&by3={by3}&by4={by4}&by5={by5}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns metadata about the best image for each of up to three airings, movies, series, seasons, episodes, or other, as determined by five possible image metadata filters.

To deliver an image specified in the response, grab the `media_image` ID for the image you want from the response and then call one these requests:
+ [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized)
+ [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster)

## GET 
This request requires one or more `data_content_images` IDs, which are returned in links in responses to the following requests. A `data_content_images` ID is the same as the ID for each of these requests.
+  [data_other](/#reference/other/dataother)
+  [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing)
+  [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie)
+  [data_series](/#reference/series/dataseries)
+  [data_season](/#reference/season/dataseason)
+  [data_episode](/#reference/episode/dataepisode)

Note:  The {by} parameters can sort results by value of response fields. The most useful response fields to sort are:

`people` &emsp; Number of people in the image.

`weight` &emsp; Prominance of cast members in the image, where:
+  zero means no cast members
+  a higher number means fewer and less prominent cast members
+  a lower number means more and more prominent cast members

`zoom` &emsp; Maximum zoom level, or close-up level, of the image:

| Zoom Level | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| head       | Head or shoulders to top of head.     |
| torso      | Chest or thigh to top of head.        |
| body       | Body fills at least 80% of frame.     |
| framed     | Full body fills 50% to 80% of frame.  |
| std        | Full body fills 50% of frame or less. |

`type` &emsp; Type of image:

| Image Type | Description                | Image Type | Description                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------   |
| album      | Album cover front          | key        | Key cast or show image       |

| box        | VHS box cover              | olympic    | Olympic image                |
| celebrity  | Celebrity                  | poster     | Poster art                   |
| dvd        | DVD box cover              | prod       | Key cast on set              |
| gallery    | Key cast, no set           | prod2      | Supporting cast on set       |
| gallery2   | Supporting cast, no set    | program    | Key cast from program        |
| generic    | Placeholder iconography    | program2   | Supporting cast from program |

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    A `data_content_images` ID, returned in responses to the following requests. A `data_content_images` ID is the same as the ID for each of these requests.
      +  [data_other](/#reference/other/dataother)
      +  [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing)
      +  [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie)
      +  [data_series](/#reference/series/dataseries)
      +  [data_season](/#reference/season/dataseason)
      +  [data_episode](/#reference/episode/dataepisode)
      
  + id2 (optional, integer, `916717280`)
    A second `data_content_images` ID for a movie or TV program.
  + id3 (optional, integer, `916638563`)
    A third `data_content_images` ID for a movie or TV program.
  + by (optional, string, `people`)
    Response field to sort by. Only top-level response fields are valid, not objects or fields in objects.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: *people*. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: *-people*.
      +  To insert a value at the top of the sort, replace {by} with the field and value, like this: *zoom=head*.
      +  To filter out a value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: "weight=!0".
      
  + by2 (optional, string, `type=key`)
    Second level sort specification.
  + by3 (optional, string, `type`)
    Third level sort specification.
  + by4 (optional, string, `zoom`)
    Fourth level sort specification.
  + by5 (optional, string, `zoom`)
    Fifth level sort specification.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_release_images/collection [/data_release_images/collection?id={id}&page={page}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns metadata about the images available for a release of a movie, episode, or other show.

To deliver an image specified in the response, grab the `media_image` ID for the image you want from the response and then call one of these requests:
+ [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized)
+ [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster)

## GET 
This request requires a `data_release_images` ID for a release. A `data_release_images` ID is the same as the `data_release` ID for the release.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `982759625`)
    A `data_release_images` ID for a release of a movie, episode, or other show. A `data_release_images` ID is the same as the `data_release` ID for the release.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

Returns metadata about the best image for each of up to three releases, as determined by five possible image metadata filters.

To deliver an image specified in the response, grab the `media_image` ID for the image you want from the response and then call one these requests:
+ [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized)
+ [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster)

## GET 
This request requires one or more `data_release_images` IDs. A `data_release_images` ID is the same as the `data_release` ID for a release.

Note:  The {by} parameters can sort results by value of response fields. The most useful response fields to sort are:

`people` &emsp; Number of people in the image.

`weight` &emsp; Prominance of cast members in the image, where:
+  zero means no cast members
+  a higher number means fewer and less prominent cast members
+  a lower number means more and more prominent cast members

`zoom` &emsp; Maximum zoom level, or close-up level, of the image:

| Zoom Level | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| head       | Head or shoulders to top of head.     |
| torso      | Chest or thigh to top of head.        |
| body       | Body fills at least 80% of frame.     |
| framed     | Full body fills 50% to 80% of frame.  |
| std        | Full body fills 50% of frame or less. |

`type` &emsp; Type of image:

| Image Type | Description                | Image Type | Description                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------   |
| album      | Album cover front          | key        | Key cast or show image       |
| album2     | Album cover back           | league     | Sports league logo           |
| box        | VHS box cover              | olympic    | Olympic image                |
| celebrity  | Celebrity                  | poster     | Poster art                   |
| dvd        | DVD box cover              | prod       | Key cast on set              |
| gallery    | Key cast, no set           | prod2      | Supporting cast on set       |
| gallery2   | Supporting cast, no set    | program    | Key cast from program        |
| generic    | Placeholder iconography    | program2   | Supporting cast from program |

| head       | One key cast member        | team       | Sports team logo             |
| head2      | One supporting cast member | trailer    | Image for trailer, 16:9      |
| jersey     | Sports jersey              | video      | Video box cover              |

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `13554857`)
    A `data_release_images` ID for a release of a movie, episode, or other show. A `data_release_images` ID is the same as the `data_release` ID for the release.
  + id2 (optional, integer, `373544356`)
    A second `data_release_images` ID for a release.
  + id3 (optional, integer, `982759625`)
    A third `data_release_images` ID for a release.
  + by (optional, string, `people`)
    Response field to sort by. Only top-level response fields are valid, not objects or fields in objects.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: *people*. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: *-people*.
      +  To insert a value at the top of the sort, replace {by} with the field and value, like this: *zoom=head*.
      +  To filter out a value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: "weight=!0".
      
  + by2 (optional, string, `type=key`)
    Second level sort specification.
  + by3 (optional, string, `type`)
    Third level sort specification.
  + by4 (optional, string, `zoom`)
    Fourth level sort specification.
  + by5 (optional, string, `zoom`)
    Fifth level sort specification.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_name_images/collection [/data_name_images/collection?id={id}&page={page}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns metadata about images of a team, person, or organization.

To deliver an image specified in the response, grab the `media_image` ID for the image you want from the response and then call one of these requests.
+ [media_image/sized](/#reference/image/mediaimagesized)
+ [media_image/master](/#reference/image/mediaimagemaster)

## GET 
This request requires a `data_name_images` ID, which is returned in links in responses to [data_person](/#reference/tv-and-movie-data/dataperson) requests. A `data_name_images` ID is the same as the `data_person` ID for a person.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `6779589`)
    A `data_name_images` ID, returned in a response to a [data_person](/#reference/tv-and-movie-data/dataperson) request. A `data_name_images` ID is the same as the `data_person` ID for a person.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

Returns metadata about the best image for each of up to three teams, people, or organizations, as determined by five possible image metadata filters.

## GET 
This request requires one or more `data_name_images` IDs, which are returned in links in responses to [data_person](/#reference/tv-and-movie-data/dataperson) requests. A `data_name_images` ID is the same as the `data_person` ID for a person.

The {by} parameters filter results by response fields. The most useful response fields to filter with this parameter are:

`people` &emsp; Number of people in the image.

`zoom` &emsp; Maximum zoom level, or close-up level, of the image:

| Zoom Level | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| head       | Head or shoulders to top of head.     |
| torso      | Chest or thigh to top of head.        |
| body       | Body fills at least 80% of frame.     |
| framed     | Full body fills 50% to 80% of frame.  |
| std        | Full body fills 50% of frame or less. |

`type` &emsp; Type of image:

| Image Type | Description                | Image Type | Description                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------   |
| album      | Album cover front          | key        | Key cast or show image       |

| box        | VHS box cover              | olympic    | Olympic image                |
| celebrity  | Celebrity                  | poster     | Poster art                   |
| dvd        | DVD box cover              | prod       | Key cast on set              |
| gallery    | Key cast, no set           | prod2      | Supporting cast on set       |
| gallery2   | Supporting cast, no set    | program    | Key cast from program        |
| generic    | Placeholder iconography    | program2   | Supporting cast from program |

| head       | One key cast member        | team       | Sports team logo             |
| head2      | One supporting cast member | trailer    | Image for trailer, 16:9      |
| jersey     | Sports jersey              | video      | Video box cover              |

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `6778528`)
    A `data_name_images` ID, returned in a response to a [data_person](/#reference/person/dataperson) request. A `data_name_images` ID is the same as the `data_person` ID for a person.
  + id2 (optional, integer, `6779589`)
    The `data_name_images` ID for a second person, team, or organization.
  + id3 (optional, integer, `6781337`)
    The `data_name_images` ID for a second person, team, or organization.
  + by (optional, string, `people`)
    Response field to sort by. Only top-level response fields are valid, not objects or fields in objects.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __people__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: __-people__.
      +  To insert a value at the top of the sort, replace {by} with the field and value, like this: __zoom=head__.
      +  To filter out a value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __zoom=!std__.
      
  + by2 (optional, string, `people`)
    Second level sort specification.
  + by3 (optional, string, `people`)
    Third level sort specification.
  + by4 (optional, string, `people`)
    Fourth level sort specification.
  + by5 (optional, string, `people`)
    Fifth level sort specification.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

+  [discover_all_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoverallvideobygenrecontent)
+  [discover_all_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoverallvideobysearchcontent)

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    The `data_movie` ID for the movie, returned in responses to the following requests:
      +  [data_airing](/#reference/tv-schedule/dataairing)
      +  [data_movie_appearances](/#reference/tv-schedule/datamovieappearances)
      +  [discover_all_similar_video/movie](/#reference/recommendations/discoverallsimilarvideomovie)
      +  [discover_all_video_by_genre/movie](/#reference/search/discoverallvideobygenremovie)

      +  [discover_all_similar_video/content](/#reference/recommendations/discoverallsimilarvideocontent)
      +  [discover_all_video_by_genre/content](/#reference/search/discoverallvideobygenrecontent)
      +  [discover_all_video_by_search/content](/#reference/search/discoverallvideobysearchcontent)
      
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.

# data_movie_credits/cast [/data_movie_credits/cast?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}&page={page}&by={by}] 
Returns cast credits for a movie.

## GET
This request requires the `data_movie_credits` ID for the movie, which is returned in responses to the [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) request. A `data_movie_credits` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    The `data_movie_credits` ID for the movie, returned in responses to the [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) request. A `data_movie_credits` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + by (optional, string, `role`)
    Response field or object.field to sort by. Child fields must be single-valued, that is, not within an array.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __role__ or __person.alts.last__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: __-role__.
      +  To start with items that contain a particular field, replace {by} with a field-equals-not-null, like this: __person.image=!null__. To start with items that are missing a particular field, specify a field-equals-null, like this: __person.image=null__. 
      +  To start with items that contain a particular value in a top-level field, replace {by} with field-equals-value, like this: __role=Tony Stark__. To end with items that contain a particular value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __role=!Tony Stark__.
      +  Combine alpha and numeric sorts in a comma-separated list in left-to-right priority.
    
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_movie_credits/crew [/data_movie_credits/crew?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}&page={page}&by={by}] 
Returns crew credits for a movie.

## GET
This request requires the `data_movie_credits` ID for the movie, which is returned in responses to the [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) request. A `data_movie_credits` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    The `data_movie_credits` ID for the movie, returned in responses to the [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) request. A `data_movie_credits` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + by (optional, string, `type`)
    Response field or object.field to sort by. Child fields must be single-valued, that is, not within an array.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __credit__ or __person.alts.last__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) sign like this: __-credit__.
      +  To start with items that contain a particular field, replace {by} with a field-equals-not-null, like this: __person.image=!null__. To start with items that are missing a particular field, specify a field-equals-null, like this: __type=null__. 
      +  To start with items that contain a particular value in a top-level field, replace {by} with field-equals-value, like this: __type=director__. To end with items that contain a particular value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __type=!company__.
      +  Combine alpha and numeric sorts in a comma-separated list in left-to-right priority.
         
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_movie_credits/credits [/data_movie_credits/credits?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}&page={page}&by={by}] 
Returns both cast and crew credits for movie.

## GET
This request requires the `data_movie_credits` ID for the movie, which is returned in responses to the [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) request. A `data_movie_credits` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    The `data_movie_credits` ID for the movie, returned in responses to the [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) request. A `data_movie_credits` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.
  + by (optional, string, `credit`)
    Response field or object.field to sort by. Child fields must be single-valued, that is, not within an array.
      +  For an ascending sort, replace {by} with the field name like this: __credit__ or __person.alts.last__. For a descending sort, precede the field name with a minus (-) like this: __-credit__.
      +  To start with items that contain a particular field, replace {by} with field-equals-not-null, like this: __person.image=!null__. To start with items that are missing a particular field, specify field-equals-null, like this: __role=null__. 
      +  To start with items that contain a particular value in a top-level field, replace {by} with field-equals-value, like this: __type=director__. To end with items that contain a particular value, precede the value with an exclamation like this: __type=!company__.
      +  Combine alpha and numeric sorts in a comma-separated list in left-to-right priority.
    
+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_movie_related [/data_movie_related?id={id}&relation={relation}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}&page={page}]
Returns titles of related programs and movies:
+ series in
+ similar to
+ related to
+ spoofed or spoofed by
+ remake of or remade as
+ features or featured in
+ re-edit of or re-edited by
+ spin-off of or spun-off as
+ preceeded by or preceeded
+ influenced by or influenced

## GET
This request requires the `data_movie_related` ID for the movie, which is returned in responses to [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) requests. A `data_movie_related` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `915165185`)
    The `data_movie_related` ID for the movie, returned in responses to [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) requests. A `data_movie_related` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
  + relation (optional, string, `similar`)
    The relationship, specified as one of the following. Leave this value empty to return titles for all relationships.
      +  featured
      +  influenced
      +  predecessor
      +  re-edit
      +  related
      +  remake
      +  similar
      +  series
      +  spin-off
      +  spoof
      
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_movie_releases [/data_movie_releases?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}&page={page}]
Returns information about releases of a movie. Releases differ in language, content, or title.

## GET
This request requires the `data_movie_releases` ID for the movie, which is returned in responses to [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) requests. A `data_movie_releases` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `914806985`)
    The `data_movie_releases` ID for the movie, returned in responses to [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) requests. A `data_movie_releases` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
  + page (optional, integer, `1`)
    Page number to return. Default is 1, which returns the first page in a list of items. A page number greater than the number of available pages returns status code 404.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# data_movie_review [/data_movie_review?id={id}&in={in}&in2={in2}&in3={in3}]
Returns a professional review of a movie.

## GET
This request requires the `data_movie_review` ID for the movie, which is returned in responses to [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) requests. A `data_movie_review` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, integer, `905191267`)
    The `data_movie_review` ID for the movie, returned in responses to [data_movie](/#reference/movie/datamovie) requests. A `data_movie_review` ID is the same as the `data_movie` ID for the movie.
  + in (optional, string, `en-US`)
    Language and country of the response data. Replace {in} with an ISO 639 language and ISO 3166-1 country code like this: __en-US__. If data is unavailable for that language and country, we try your {in2} and then {in3} choices. 
    <br> &emsp; To specify language only, replace country with an asterisk like this: __en-\*__. To specify the default, the language and country associated with the content, use just an asterisk: __\*__. 
    <br> &emsp; If you specify only language-and-country choices and those choices are unavailable, we will fall back to 1) just the language, 2) the language in another region, or 3) the default, in that order. To prevent the fallback and return a 404 error if your choices are unavailable, specify __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk) in {in2} or {in3}. For a list of languages and countries with strong data support, see "Supported Locales" in the _Getting Started_ section.
  + in2 (optional, string, `en-*`)
    Second choice for language or localized content, specified in the same way: __fr-CA__ or __fr-\*__ or __\*__. To limit results instead to the first choice and return a 404 error for unavailable content, replace {in2} with __!\*__ (exclamation and asterisk).
  + in3 (optional, string, `*`)
    Third choice for language or localized content. If there is still no content match, we follow the standard fallback rules. To limit results to the previous choices, replace {in3} with __!\*__.
     
+ Response 200 (application/json)
